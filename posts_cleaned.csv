39,39,"What are my chances?
Hey everyone!

I'm currently a junior at a catholic high school in San Francisco and I'm very interested in **Mechanical Engineering** (minor in Aerospace) at SCU for Fall 2025. Overall I have a pretty sub-par resume due to my underclassmen years, but here is my general rundown of academic profile:

GPA (UW): 3.55

GPA (Weighted): 3.69

Junior Year GPA: 4.27

SAT: 1390

  -  Math:  740

  -  English: 650

2 AP’s taken, One community college course, 3 AP’s in senior year.

For Extracurriculars I'm the photo editor for our school newspaper/magaine, soon to be managing editor for our magazine, One of the 4 big leaders in student spirit and activities at my school, Eagle Scout, School tour guide, and active member of our rocketry club (building rockets competitively). Oh, every summer for the past 4 years I've been a full time (Boy) Scout camp counselor, where I live independently for 8 weeks and run a large outdoor summer camp in NorCal. 

Anyways, chance me! For the sake of argument, let's say I apply **Early Decision 1**, because it's really my top school.",1cp9tqh,5,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False

You log into your admissions portal to register.

[https://www.scu.edu/orientation/registration/](https://www.scu.edu/orientation/registration/)

&#x200B;

FIRST-YEAR ORIENTATION SESSIONS

All first-year students are required to attend and participate in Orientation for the entire two-day overnight session in July. Orientation check-in begins at 7:30 AM on the first day, and the first session begins at 8:30 AM. Orientation Leaders will be stationed around campus to direct you to the check-in location at Swig Residence Hall. You will be permitted to check out on the second day of your session after the closing ceremony.

TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

We advise that you not make air travel arrangements requiring a departure before 4:00 PM after Day 2 of your Orientation session. Late arrival or early departure may impact your ability to register for fall quarter classes and/or result in your reassignment to another session.

STAYING OVERNIGHT

All first-year students, including students planning to live off campus in the fall, are required to stay overnight in Swig Residence Hall as part of Orientation. Parents and families should make their own arrangements for overnight lodging off campus.

LIMITED SPACE

It is important to note that space is capped at a maximum limit for each of our July sessions, so please know there is one session on September 19. If you would like to request a change to your registered Orientation session, please contact us at orientation@scu.edu. Again, space for each session is limited so moving from one session to another is not guaranteed.

102,102,"Santa Clara University or UC Santa Cruz, Which Should I choose?
 Hi so I recently got accepted into Santa Clara University (SCU) and UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) as the two top colleges I am currently debating on. I got accepted into the biology major for both but right now I really am not sure which to choose. My main priorities for the college is how much I'll enjoy my time there, the location, education, and research opportunities. I will most likely be going for graduate school after college so I want to choose the college that I will both love and gain the most out of.

I've lived in Santa Clara basically all my life and I'm not sure if SCU is somewhere I'd enjoy going to if it's going to be the same area I've always known. At the same time looking at UC Santa Cruz's campus it looks amazing. I absolutely would love to go there just for the nature itself but there are also other factors holding me back.

At the same time I know that SCU will give me a better education most likely. Being more prestigious and having smaller class sizes will be helpful. And the educational focus of the school is something that I value in a college. UCSC from what I've seen is overpopulated and it will be hard to get in contact with professors with TA's teaching some classes? I'm not too sure about this fact.

In terms of costs, because I could live at home they will most likely end up being at the same price, though financial aid offers from UCSC have not come out yet and it doesn't look like it will before the decision deadline is over for SCU.

Something I really have no clue about is the research opportunities at both these universities. Will UCSC give more opportunity being a UC and one that focuses on Biology or will SCU be the better option because of the smaller class sizes?

I really feel like I'm torn between the mature option and the ""fun"" option. But at the same time I know that both will be providing me the same degree.

I really just have no clue what to do at this point. If there's any other factors I should consider please let me know because I have genuinely spent over 3 hours now flip flopping between the two schools. It's like each day my stance changes on which I want to go to.",1c22i9j,2,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False
