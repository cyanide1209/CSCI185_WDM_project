1,"Advice Paper for Incoming COEN/CS Students
Hi all! I wrote a paper with advice for incoming/current COEN and CS CAS students while I was a senior COEN at SCU last year.

Paper linked here: [https://jrandleman.github.io/doc/CoenAdvice.pdf](https://jrandleman.github.io/doc/CoenAdvice.pdf)

Some background on myself, I was the lead engineering peer advisor and president of Tau Beta Pi (the engineering honor society), both of which regularly interface with new folks seeking advice. As such, I thought I'd compile it all in a paper while such was fresh in my mind. Designed as a paper I wish I could've read as a Freshman, I hope it brings value to folks :)

Please also keep in mind this is 100% my own personal perspective, and that many others have found great success in the program(s) by following a completely different path. This is just what worked for me, and hence I thought I'd share.

I'm also currently a Master's COEN student at SCU, so feel free to reach me at [jrandleman@scu.edu](mailto:jrandleman@scu.edu) if you have any questions!

Last note: I've marked the flair as ""listing"" given this could be construed as listing advice ü§∑",xkfy3u,46

19,"Which school to choose to land a tech job?

About me:

I‚Äôm an international student from Asia and I don‚Äôt have a green card. I majored in EECS and focused on two tracks- IC chip design and controlling system during college. On top of that. I‚Äôve also worked on two big medical-image-recognition projects that based on Deep Learning and two small bioengineering projects that involved with a device that detected patients‚Äô blood leak.


My offers: 

I‚Äôve gotten masters offers from three schools. (2024 Fall)

1. Santa Clara U, MS in computer science and engineering.
2. Arizona State U, MS in computer engineering. 
3. U of Arizona, MS in electrical and computer engineering.

My plan: 

My ultimate goal is to land a a tech job in the states. However, given the extremely competitive market in software engineering, I‚Äôve planned to work on a different field other than SE. I‚Äôm thinking of designing processors for AI models, or just IC chips.

That being said, I think I might just go and start do research with a prof upon getting into grad school and apply for PhD on the way to further study about the mentioned topic and have a better job security, considering that it is very unlikely for foreign grad students to land a job with this economy.

My Question:

So my question is that which school should I choose ? SCU is close to Silicon Valley while ASU is close to TSMC and Intel(and ASU seems to have more courses/profs in the mentioned fieldü§î).

Please feel free to share your experiences and thoughts, as well as how the PhD plan seems. Should I just go straight job hunting as soon as I enter grad school and hope that I can find a job or at least an internship by the time I graduate? What EECS job can I get with this MS degree if I‚Äôm not going with software engineering?

I'm trying to decide between Santa Clara University (SCU) and New York University (NYU) and could use some advice. I have committed to SCU, but I got accepted from the waitlist at NYU and I will have to decide soon. While I'm still waiting on financial aid for NYU, SCU currently seems like the better option due to merit scholarships (yes, money is a problem). Here are my thoughts so far:

Major:

NYU (Tandon School of Engineering): Business and Technology Management

SCU (Leavey School of Business): Management Information Systems

**Santa Clara University (SCU)**

PROS:

* Location: Right in the heart of Silicon Valley (perfect for internships).
* Convenience: Will be staying at home.
* Higher Median Pay: SCU graduates report strong median salaries.
* Campus: SCU has a real campus, unlike NYU.
* Scholarships and Cost: Significant financial aid makes it more affordable.
* Quality of Teaching: Higher quality undergraduate teaching along with smaller classes.

CONS:

* Location: I've lived in the area for my whole life.
* Quarter System: Classes go by very fast.

**New York University (NYU)**

PROS:

* Curriculum: Like my major's curriculum better at NYU in terms of classes.
* Semester System: Classes don't go by as fast.
* Prestige: Highly prestigious and better overall ranking.
* Career Opportunities: Likely better for career advancement due to prestige and strong business program (even though the major itself is not in Stern) although SCU also has a strong alumni network.
* Location: Prefer NYU's location (especially the Brooklyn campus) as a change from California.

CONS:

* Cost: Extremely expensive and no financial aid confirmed yet.
* Adaptation: Big change from my current environment (I have never lived in the city before), which could be challenging.

Main Consideration:

Money is the main issue right now, but if finances end up being similar, which one would you choose and why?

Hi, I got waitlisted at SCU on Feb 15th for CSE in the school of engineering.

I sent a letter of continued interest, I had the company I interened at to send a letter of rec, and I also attended an official campus visit. I've been in contact with my to-be counselor since January being proactive and asking questions as needed during my admissions process.

What else can I do to make myself more appealing to SCU.

I would love to go to this school but I don't know any other ways to express that.

P.S I've already accepted the waitlist offer and also checked the mark to be considered for ""Web design and engineering  
and attnded the ""waitlist webinar""

FIRST-YEAR ORIENTATION SESSIONS

All first-year students are required to attend and participate in Orientation for the entire two-day overnight session in July. Orientation check-in begins at 7:30 AM on the first day, and the first session begins at 8:30 AM.

You will be permitted to check out on the second day of your session after the closing ceremony.

TRAVEL ARRANGEMENTS

We advise that you not make air travel arrangements requiring a departure before 4:00 PM after Day 2 of your Orientation session. Late arrival or early departure may impact your ability to register for fall quarter classes and/or result in your reassignment to another session.

STAYING OVERNIGHT

All first-year students, including students planning to live off campus in the fall, are required to stay overnight in Swig Residence Hall as part of Orientation. Parents and families should make their own arrangements for overnight lodging off campus.

LIMITED SPACE

It is important to note that space is capped at a maximum limit for each of our July sessions, so please know there is one session on September 19. If you would like to request a change to your registered Orientation session, please contact us at orientation@scu.edu.

101,"Santa Clara University or UC Santa Cruz, Which Should I choose?
 Hi so I recently got accepted into Santa Clara University (SCU) and UC Santa Cruz (UCSC) as the two top colleges I am currently debating on. I got accepted into the biology major for both but right now I really am not sure which to choose. My main priorities for the college is how much I'll enjoy my time there, the location, education, and research opportunities. I will most likely be going for graduate school after college so I want to choose the college that I will both love and gain the most out of.

I've lived in Santa Clara basically all my life and I'm not sure if SCU is somewhere I'd enjoy going to if it's going to be the same area I've always known. At the same time looking at UC Santa Cruz's campus it looks amazing. I absolutely would love to go there just for the nature itself but there are also other factors holding me back.

At the same time I know that SCU will give me a better education most likely. Being more prestigious and having smaller class sizes will be helpful. And the educational focus of the school is something that I value in a college. UCSC from what I've seen is overpopulated and it will be hard to get in contact with professors with TA's teaching some classes? I'm not too sure about this fact.

In terms of costs, because I could live at home they will most likely end up being at the same price, though financial aid offers from UCSC have not come out yet and it doesn't look like it will before the decision deadline is over for SCU.

Something I really have no clue about is the research opportunities at both these universities. Will UCSC give more opportunity being a UC and one that focuses on Biology or will SCU be the better option because of the smaller class sizes?

I really feel like I'm torn between the mature option and the ""fun"" option. But at the same time I know that both will be providing me the same degree.

I really just have no clue what to do at this point. If there's any other factors I should consider please let me know because I have genuinely spent over 3 hours now flip flopping between the two schools. It's like each day my stance changes on which I want to go to.",1c22i9j,2

Hi Everyone! I'm looking for some advice about the counseling program at SCU.

160,"Students Are Selfish At This School
No doubt, students are nice (not mean or malicious), but I found that most students are very rude at SCU.  
Example1: I booked a room at Lucas hall one day, and there were a group there, I showed them that I booked a room, and they just refused to leave. People also go into rooms without booking, and take their time to leave even though  they are over time. People also don't cancel their booking after they are done using the rooms.  
Example 2; When I was playing basketball, I had to wait two games so did another guy, then we just rock paper scissors for a spot, he cheated cause he was impatient and didn't want to wait for longer  
Example 3: I tutor on wyzant, and I had a scu junior student want to schedule an appointment with her. She wanted in person and booked a room somewhere where. I don't visit frequently. But anyways, I was helping her, I told her the right things except one thing (which I obviously don't see on a regular basis), and within 15 minutes of the session, she wanted to call the session without paying for it. Now in all fairness, I did tell her if it didn't work out in 15 minutes please call it. Wyzant also has a bunch of rude clients, i've had these kind of things happen to me, but this was the first in person one.

Students also talk on the phone really loudly, scream in the halls, never use headphones while listening to audio.

And the evening MBA program is just a whole other story, i'm being treated poorly every day in the program. People are also users in the program

I feel like SCU students aren't mean, but they are very self preserved and selfish, and will hurt someone else just to make sure they do not get hurt. I'd say the good thing though, is this hasn't gotten to any extreme level where it has really hurt me.

For the newly admitted mech students: If you are a passionate student who enjoys hands on work and doing projects, this school will likely not be a good fit for you. The engineering school, as a whole, has extremely limited opportunities to actually apply classroom knowledge to real world applications‚Äîthat is until your senior design project which is 3 years into your education and even that has a very limited scope. 

The mech department specifically sucks. They‚Äôre under staffed, too many students, poor advisors, not enough class sections‚Äîdefinitely not worth the $80k to not get into your required major classes (don‚Äôt be fooled by the small school selling point on this)

Do yourself a favor and go to a school that has the resources to support student engineering projects such as fsae, Baja, aiaa, concrete canoe, metal bridge, human powered vehicle, solar cars‚Äîthese are just a few for specifically mech. There‚Äôs so many opportunities that students here miss out on due to poor allocation of resources (they pay wayyy to much for gardeners here).

I‚Äôm not saying it‚Äôs a bad school at all and for some just being in an engineering program is a feat of its own so props to you all for that.

217,"Student Employees Are Always On There Phones While Working On The Clock
Whenever I go to the library, gym, ie. The student employees are always on their phones, and they are sometimes not paying attention to their surroundings. For example, when I asked a guy a question at the front desk library, he got a call at the same time and chose to answer his PERSONAL call over helping me out. I was at Lucas hall and I was trying to buy something and the cashier was on her phone for 10 minutes before getting to me. I went to the basketball gym and I saw one of the IM refs stream a movie on his phone, while officiating. When I checked in to the gym, the front desk guy didn't notice me until a few minutes later.

With that being said, I have a few questions:

1. I feel like SCU overstaffs admins and employees, and they also create jobs that they don't need. That's not fair to the students who pay all that tuition. Like there are two/three people working there while they are just doing their homework on the clock.
2. Has anyone had these student jobs. Do they literally allow the students to do this? That's unprofessional and poor management. I mean yeah I see other employees do this at other places especially when there is down time, but this happens more at SCU. I also never saw any other employees take a call while they are talking to a customer
3. In the evening MBA program, those who work  at SCU are always doing bad in their class, and have bad business ethics. They all like to work remotely because they want to do other things while they're on the clock.

I'm an evening MBA student, and I thought the evening mba program was lame, so I tried to get a little more involved with undergrad life, but am also thinking it's lame. I went to college at UC Davis. But here I noticed that no one attempts to make friendly conversations at all, people want to keep to themselves, people tend to be clicky and exclusive. I've joined a few clubs on campus, go to the gym but it seems lame. Also I notice there tends not to be a lot of student involvement. I feel like most people just work and go to school, that's the vibe I get. People at UC Davis were a lot more friendly. It was easier stiring up conversations with strangers, other people approached me. Also I feel like most students there were full time students not working or working minimal hours while attending school. There is a lot more employment opportunity in the sillcon valley then there is in Davis. This is the vibe I get, correct me if I'm wrong.

Also, it seems like undergrad business students don't do well in their academics like the evening MBA students. For example, many students find accounting 3000 to be very difficult. I didn't think it was difficult at all, and simply way overhyped. I just think people don't put in the time, that's why they struggle so much as priorities are not in the right place. Students at UC Davis did not find financial accounting to be difficult, they all excelled in these classes.

252,"Learn To Play Broomball
Hi everyone!

In coordination with Sharks ice we are trying to bring Broomball more formally to the Bay area, woohoo!

What is broomball?

Simply, it's hockey for people who can't skate well. The game is played on ice in special shoes (which we can provide). The game is a bit slower than hockey and safer. The rules and strategies are almost identical. If you can run, you can play broomball!

Here is a short primer showing what the sport is although in current format we usually play ¬Ω ice:  https://youtu.be/FbPEcFmKWbw?feature=shared 

Who plays broomball?

Players come from various backgrounds. Some are hockey players, some are slow pitch softball regulars, and others are office workers that are looking for a fun hobby that also happens to be a great workout. Players range from 15 years old to over 50+. Think you might be out of place? We don't think so! Broomball is an easy game to pick up and learn to play, but can take some practice to perfect.

How safe is it?

Broomball shoes give you some grip on the ice, but you'll still slide around a bit in a controlled manner. Checking is not allowed. Pads for the knees, elbows, and shins can also help. The rink provides helmets and sticks!

This sounds fun, when will the next game be?

We currently have drop in events at two rinks, weekly at San Jose Sharks Ice and getting started near every other week at Oakland Ice Center.
San Jose: Tuesdays at 10pm, starting 1/9
Oakland: Mondays at 8:45, currently 1/22, 2/12, 2/26

You can register here https://apps.daysmartrecreation.com/dash/x/#/online/sharks/event-registration?date=2024-01-09&&sport_ids=38 or via the sharks ice website via their drop in event calendar, filter via Broomball.",192tq8e,5

I don't know how to cope with my frustrations. It's very expensive, and I hate being in person in class. There is about a 50/50 probability that there will be no ROI in the program. I want to quit, but I am too invested in it, but I have a little more left to go in the program.  I feel the program wasn't a right fit for me. It absolutely wasn't what I thought it would be. I feel like there is no support system in the program because no one cares about each other in the program. Everyone is very nice(for the most part) , but I feel like I don't vibe with people in the program just because of personality differences. Santa Clara University sucks for making deeper connections, people are very exclusive and clicky.  It wasn't like my undergraduate program, where people were more friendly(though people there were very mean, so that is a tradeoff) . I feel like people there are polite but not so much friendly. Most students especially in the MBA program want to keep boundaries, and have other priorities. Like if that is the vibe with the program then what is the purpose of even being there . I did a somewhat related major in my undergrad, and every class I am taking is the same in which I took my undergrad at. I do have positive things to say about the program, but I am just not happy there and I just don't want to be there. It feels like a community college to be frankly honest. Seems to be a lack of student engagement within the MBA community.  Idk if this is just the nature of it being a part time MBA program. But the program has only gotten worse and worse over time. I feel like the program gave me a false impression but in all fairness I had misconceptions as well due to me being at a younger age. I'm starting to realize everything growing up was a lie, right here at this time.I just don't like people in general, I think a lot of people are rude, inconsiderate, and selfish. And we have our differences

Three things really bother me with the program:

1. Obviously the tuition, being significantly overpriced
2. Commuting, and being in person. Santa Clara as a city is terribly managed, entities always have operational problems and are unprofessional due to the nature, geographic, and economics of the city. In. many ways SCU has common resemblance with this. Theres always technical, and maintenance problems at the school. Events get canceled with continual no shows.
3. There are a lot of group projects which are heavily counted towards grades. A lot of students tend to slack off and not do any work or do work at the very last minute, and each quarter I had to deal with this. I really don't even care about grades that much, but I don't want it hurt on my individual grade due to a lack of responsibilities carried by the team. That wouldn't be fair on my end. The good thing(and I am so thankful for this, that the professors only grade them and all other non quantitive material, based on the effort you put). It's also been frustrating having to hear and do more changes at the last minute.

I'm not happy there, I am considering doing the online program, but I feel like I wouldn't be happy with that as well.

Idk if any comments are going to help me, but I just wrote this for the sole purpose of letting out my frustrations. Also, there is not much information about the program. I've read some threads on reddit about the program and a lot of it is BS. Also, everything on their website is BS, and  everything they claim that the program would be is also BS.

I got many good things out of the program. I feel like I did grow and learn, and it attributed to my professional career. Some professors and staff are very smart, and helped guide me further. Before this program started, I was probably the unluckiest person in the planet, but things have changed in terms of that when it started. So I do have mixed feelings I have seen results from this program, but not anything exponentially.

P.S I was already a business/working professional prior to this program, and I am in my late 20s.",186ekiv,1

My son is a HS senior and we just did the tour at Santa Clara this morning.  There was a lot I liked, but there was ‚Ä¶ something off (if you‚Äôve seen Stepford Wives you know what I‚Äôm talking about). 

The campus was gorgeous and I think I only saw six weeds the whole walk.  The buildings were new and impressive and the dorms were good.  But my spidey sense was tingling, like I wasn‚Äôt getting the full scoop. 

My son wants to major in psych, and we were led on the tour by a math/CS major so got few details on the humanities at SCU.  My goes to a small HS, so he leans towards smaller schools and since we toured USF, I wanted him to see SCU as well.   He‚Äôs applying to Cal, but I think he knows it‚Äôs a long shot, even though he‚Äôs a strong applicant.  I‚Äôm a Cal alum, and we went to campus a lot when he was little, so that‚Äôs the only big school he‚Äôs OK with.   I wouldn‚Äôt have thought of SCU as a party school, but in reading through this sub, it appears I was wrong.  He‚Äôs not a partier - at all (I‚Äôm sure - I know everyone just went ‚Äúyeah, right, mom‚Ä¶. ‚Äú) and has dismissed applying to UCSB because he‚Äôd never go there because it‚Äôs a ‚Äúparty school‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôd be happy at a small school with a huge party scene or one that‚Äôs unavoidable.  I knew plenty of kids at Cal who weren‚Äôt partiers, but there were literally thousands more people you can choose to hang out with.

I'm from Miami, and I really wanted to leave for college so I applied in multiple places out of the country, and on the west coast. Out of all the US schools, Santa Clara was the best financial decision and in the UK I had only received an offer from York so I commuted to SCU. However, yesterday I received an offer from Kings College in London, which was one of my first choices when I applied. 
I really like SCU, I toured it and became somewhat comfortable with it, but I do have to consider that Kings is a part of the Russell group and a notably higher ranked school

However i've accustomed myself to the idea of moving to Santa Clara. I have family there, and I love San Francisco, it's only an hour drive a way. 
On the other hand, I'd be moving from a fast paced city to somewhat of a rural town and London does appeal to me much more in that sense. I also have family in London. 
I'd be paying practically the same for either one. 

I'm an english major and Santa Clara is right in Silicon valley. The emphasis around there is on tech, and it's really not my thing. I had always wanted to go to a liberal arts institution, but it just didn't work out that way. 
I guess for anyone who's read this far i'm just wondering ..
Do I move to California or London?

 Dear r/SCU users,

As most of you have already heard by now, Reddit‚Äôs new API price changes will have a [severe detrimental impact on third-party apps, essentially forcing them to shut down](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13xh1e7/an_open_letter_on_the_state_of_affairs_regarding/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1). If you use a third-party app to browse Reddit, you will no longer be able to do so starting 1st July.

Furthermore, because Reddit‚Äôs native app is not designed to accommodate people with visual impairments, [starting 1st July](https://www.reddit.com/r/ModCoord/comments/13zbf3n/reddit_to_the_visually_impaired_you_no_longer/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=ioscss&utm_content=2&utm_term=1) they will be forced to either quit using Reddit altogether, or switch to Old Reddit on desktop, which might eventually face shutdown too.

In protest against this, we decided to join a growing list of subreddits and will disable new posts and comments on r/SCU starting on June 12 @ 12:00AM PST, meaning you will not be able to access the subreddit until Reddit reverts these changes.

I was recently accepted to Santa Clara under civil engineering, and received the Presidential Scholarship which is full tuition.

I don‚Äôt want to commit to a school and not be able to maintain that gpa and end up spending $60,000 in tuition when I was expecting $0. 

I am just wondering how difficult the program is, especially as it compares to engineering at other schools. Are there weed out classes?

Started full time school in Spring 2021, completing 15 credits, and then did more classes in summer completing 6 credits, and I have two withdrawals-one during summer and fall 2021 because of financial issues due to COVID which I explained in my app. I have a 4.0 in all classes taken after graduating, and so my total GPA is 3.88, from 15 credits in the summer, 6 credits in the summer, and 3 from 2017. Currently enrolled in 13 credits and doing well so my midterm report should show a 4.0 for this semester as well.

Hi, I‚Äôm an applicant for the class of 2026, and I just want to say happy New Years first off.

I understand what had happened in SCU this past semester, and I want to hear from you guys, the students, on what the school truly values. Im finding mixed opinions on the administrations, the ways classes are graded, and lots of frustration.

I picked SCU because of its mission - I truly believe no education is complete without the heart. Without compassion, empathy, and it‚Äôs not a feeling, it is actual action. Yet I know the hard part is living it out, we can all sugarcoat.

Needless to say, I had my fair share of grief last year. I understand the feeling of losing a dear friend to schoolwork and loneliness, and I want to ask you about this atmosphere in SCU.

Do you guys feel safe at SCU? Do you guys feel heard, seen, and known ‚Äî is it easy to reach out for help?

In no way am I bringing out past hurt, trust me, you guys truly need a break out of this. But if you feel compelled to answer, and give me a greater picture of SCU, it will sway my decision to attend the school or not.

My highschool was unforgiving of mental health breaks. Everything swept under the rugs or not talked enough. What mattered was grades, fame, popularity, what you do and who you are instead of who you are when no ones watching. Really ‚Äî how much more people like that do we need in the world?

Both comp arch classes require ELEN/COEN 21, but ELEN 122 doesn‚Äôt require COEN 20 or ELEN 120, the latter‚Äôs ELEN equivalent, where COEN 122, on the other hand, requires that COEN 20 or ELEN 120 be taken. Is it possible to take ELEN 122 in lieu of COEN 122? Also, how is ELEN 122 overall compared to COEN 122? Asking on behalf of my COEN major friend.

By the way, can an ECEN major take COEN 122?",qj8mx9,1

2. @current students-- Were 2021/1 classes online, in-person, or hybrid? And what have faculty/ECP said about what 2021/2 will look like?
3. What‚Äôs the sense of camaraderie like in ECP/MATTC? I applied bc it‚Äôs one of the few 2ary ed. teaching credential programs in the Bay still offering the on-campus, in-person experience. I want to really get to know my classmates in-person / bond with them. 
4. Difficulty & workload of the MATTC program? Time commitment to expect on coursework? I‚Äôll be doing the part-time track alongside my regular job so if anyone who did that too can answer, that‚Äôd be even better
5. How‚Äôs the faculty? Do they care more about their research, or their students? Did you feel like you got personalized attention?
6. @current students -- I know SCU grad school is a commuter school; but wondering how much commuter school *feel*  it has. Do students linger on or around campus after class to hang out?

I‚Äôm a transfer for fall 21 and have to choose between LMU and SCU. My major is business and I got into marketing for both of the schools. I‚Äôve visited both campuses and while the scu campus was nice, the town of Santa Clara did not give me a good first impression (very small and dead). On the other hand the lmu campus was also pretty nice and I like the surrounding area of it too (being next to LA is a big plus). The only thing I can‚Äôt seem to figure out is if the academics and ranking at scu would actually give me more opportunity post graduation. Tuition will be almost identical at both. I need to make a decision by June 15th so any feedback would be very appreciated! 

ps. I also got into UCSD for business economics and would have free tuition but also worried that the major wouldn‚Äôt really specialize me in anything. If someone would take this over the other 2, let me know why!",nxzzfi,7

857,"Kevin O‚ÄôBrien Resigns as President of SCU
Dear Santa Clara University community,

 

With a heavy heart but clear mind, I write to share with you personally my decision to resign as president of Santa Clara University. As I have written to you at other times during these remarkable two years, I want to share with you directly the reasons for my decision.

 

In early March, my Jesuit Provincial, Scott Santarosa, S.J., expressed concerns to me about my well-being. These concerns were based on accounts of my behavior over the past year in certain social settings with adults that did not meet the highest standards of decorum expected of me as a Jesuit. The Province investigated these concerns, and based on the results of that review, Father Santarosa asked me to enter a therapeutic program to address related personal issues, including my use of alcohol and stress management.  

 

Throughout the process, I asked for no preferential treatment because of my position, presumed the good will of all involved, and fully cooperated. In April, I entered an outpatient or nonresidential treatment program, which many Jesuits over the years have found helpful in living a full, healthy life of service. In my case, the program is expected to take four to six months. 

 

My extended absence from campus during these challenging times does not serve the university well. After much prayer and thought and out of deep love for Santa Clara, I have concluded that the best service I can offer to our beloved university is to step aside now. While my deepest desire and skill set are attuned to return to leadership, I will not know until the program‚Äôs completion how and when I can do so most effectively. As I engage this personal work, I cannot leave the university waiting, amid all the challenges we face in a very competitive landscape and given the opportunities we need to seize as we pivot to a post-pandemic context.  Finally, if the Board wishes to begin planning a search for my successor, it is vital that this work begin now.

 

At the successful completion of my treatment program, Father Santarosa expects that I will return to active ministry as a Jesuit priest, but, for the reasons above, it will not be at Santa Clara as president ‚Äì a statement which is very hard for me to write. As together we addressed challenges during the pandemic and in our movements to greater racial justice, I have loved my service here, primarily because of the people. Thank you for your company and your support, especially when the days and decisions were hard. I trust that God will use my labor here for good, even when I fell short of my or your expectations.

 

We are positioned well to emerge from these challenging months with strength and clarity of purpose. We are in very good hands with Acting President Lisa Kloppenberg's exceptional and visionary leadership. She exemplifies the best of Jesuit education. We are also blessed with the wise and skilled stewardship of our university cabinet, deans and other university leaders.

 

I am at heart a teacher and an educator, so I wish to close with a message for our students. It is important to have friends in your life, as I do now, who can speak honestly when they are concerned about you. Equally important, no matter the success or positions you achieve in life, everyone needs help at times, and it is OK to ask for help when you need it, and to allow others to care for you.

 

Know that my days begin with prayers for Santa Clara and its mission which endures with the grace of God and the goodness of so many. Wherever I might land in my next mission as a Jesuit, I will carry you with me.

 

Gratefully yours,

 

 

Kevin O‚ÄôBrien, S.J.",naw8rv,43

Ik whether or not you get those opportunities is largely dependent on your personal skills but from my understanding some of it is dependent on the school's prestige/location. There are schools in my state (I'm not a California resident) that have a decent enough CSE program but they don't have the location SCU has but abt the same prestige. Also, is there a lot of competition for these internship/job positions? Stanford and Cal aren't too far from SCU. Ik companies will probably prefer their grads but does that make these positions more scarce?",mrikx2,6

Hey All, 

I'm trying to decide between Northeastern and Santa Clara University for CS. Cost is not a factor. 

Pros for SCU:

* Located in Silicon Valley
* I live 10 minutes away
* Known for their CS program in SV
* Focus on undergraduate teaching
* Wide varieties of opportunities for CS students
* 5yr MS CS Program

Cons for SCU:

* Overall name recognition
* Too close to home

Pros for Northeastern:

* Co-op Program
* Boston and new environment
* Prestigious for their CS program
* Travel abroad

Cons for Northeastern:

* Too far away from home
* Could be difficult to adjust to a new environment 

\- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - 

And at these respective schools: 

* How hard is it to get an internship/job?
* How good and accessible are the professors?
* How is the overall quality of the cs program? 

And if I get off of the waitlisting for UCSD, should I even consider it? Even though UCSD is in a great location and has great name recognition, I heard it's pretty difficult to get the classes, internships, and jobs you need. Seems easier at SCU or Northeastern.

910,"Picking Between SCU and UCSB for Accounting
Hey there, I know this may sound like a first world problem but I am in a stump right now. I recently got accepted into Santa Clara University for accounting at the Leavey School of Business. I thought it was cool and was happy they accepted me, but I'm still waiting on decisions on some other schools. 

But tbh, I don't know if I wanna go to SCU (although I am definitely considering it). The reason is I will have a transfer acceptance from UC Santa Barbara, and will get an automatic acceptance on the day admission decisions are released since I met the school requirements via TAG. All of my friends essentially go to UCSB, and I know no one in SCU, and I am afraid I won't have that many friends transferring into SCU (I read some threads that say its extremely difficult to make new friends because everyone already has their own friend groups set up by then). On top of that, I feel like there is pressure from my family to go to Santa Clara because its closer to them (I am from the Bay Area) and they believe it is more prestigious than UCSB in terms of getting jobs and working at a start-up or tech company somewhere in the Bay. Furthermore, I do want a change of scenario as I have lived in Santa Clara for basically all of my life.

IDK maybe I am just rambling, but I would like some advice from any of you that might have been in the same scenario when it came down to colleges to decide on when transferring. Which do you think would be better in my predicament? Is the UCSB accounting program prestigious too, or should I just set my sights on Santa Clara? Also I talked to my parents about the cost and they said that tuition prices would not matter, however I do not want to be a burden and have them pull out $90K in student loans for me. If any accounting majors could offer me some advice I would be grateful. Thank you in advance!!",mku1fx,5

\-Meanwhile even though Santa Clara sort of strictly prohibits my employment opportunities to NorCal (Me wanting to live in LA more) I've heard that it is smack-dab in the middle of Silicon Valley, has a great student to faculty ratio and employment opportunities especially for a guy targeting Investment Banking, Venture Capital or Big Four in the future. \*PS: Because of recent circumstances across my family life I don't happen to have any financial constraints, which I'm thoroughly grateful for.
