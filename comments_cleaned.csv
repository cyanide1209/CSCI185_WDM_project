SCU's campus is so well-manicured. The differences in campuses are like going to a summer camp vs. a resort.

UCSC Banana Slugs used to be the school with no grades, they are hippies but still Californians. He should tour the campuses while they are in session so he can get the vibe of the students, they are almost opposite.

UC's are huge. UC and CalState students know that it will be 5 years till graduation because it's so impacted that it's difficult to get classes. This has been going on since the 1980s. Everything is a fight: food lines, class registration, etc. And yes, UCs have TAs teaching and lines a mile long to speak to the professor, versus SCU, where the professors are easily accessible during office hours and answer emails.

SCU is a beautiful campus. Because SCU doesn't want to be a commuter school, there is a mandatory 2-year dorm stay and no freshmen parking passes. SCU has a lot of businesses nearby: many diverse restaurants and a Target on El Camino Real, 10 minutes from campus (but you need a car, Zipcar, or Uber). Two malls 10 minutes from campus: [Westfield](https://www.westfield.com/united-states/valleyfair) and [Santana Row](http://www.santanarow.com/), a Safeway grocery store literally across the street from campus, Taco Bell, pizza, wraps, Ike's sandwiches and other eats across the street from campus. 

Your son should tour both campuses while they are in session and feel the vibe of the student population. SCU has smaller classes than UCs and the professors are accessible. Maybe he can shadow with a business student for a day. 

If UCSC has no business school and that is his major, it seems silly to chose that campus. Most schools have business majors, he didn't get accepted into any other schools? Arizona State?

As far as staying in the area where you grew up, going away to experience a different region is overrated unless it's a big city school.

1989,1989,zww0mm,j1ynqmt,usandfriends,"Congrats on your acceptance!

Yes, SCU classes are relatively small, and honors classes are even relatively smaller still. For example, one of my early mathematics courses only had 4 other students. You can’t really find a teacher-student ratio like that anywhere. Mostly though they will probably be similar size as regular courses, especially for the early core courses like CNI.

I don’t think the honors classes were that much more rigorous, I never had trouble with scheduling. Actually, I was on track to graduate a quarter early (however, the senior thesis classes kinda screwed with that). And for engineers there wasn’t much extra work needed for your senior thesis either. Also look into converting some regular courses into honors to fit your schedule, which usually just entails some extra work in the course’s final (depending on the professor). I would talk to the honors program manager to get specifics as they could’ve changed since I attended.

I didn’t feel like there was much difference in the dorms (I was in Casa for my first two years, then commuted after). I think I had some more choices than my friends but I don’t remember seeing anything that stood out. Most of my suite-mates were not honors students. Maybe someone else can speak more on dorms since I commuted the last two years. I feel like being able to apply earlier to courses was more helpful than dorm choice perks.

Overall, I would recommend it for engineers (or at least COEN specifically) because of how lax the program requirements were for engineers at the time. And I don’t think there is any penalty for dropping from the program if you find it’s too much. Again, I’d double check as they could’ve changed all those details since I attended.

2985,2985,pso654,hdtardz,SCUSKU,"I was able to install Phillips Hues in Graham. I had to set up my own network/router for the Phillips hue hub, and also had to reroute and cut some wires to bypass what I believe was a transformer for the default fluorescent lights. I was able to get Alexa set up with it, and it was pretty nice to be able to turn off the lights in our dorm room via voice. 

I probably would just recommend getting lamps though.",1,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
3111,3111,p3wnc7,h8uqbfm,Artistic_Kangaroo,"It all depends on the vibe you want in your room. You’re going to have a lot of room to work with in your Finn extended double. There’s definitely a good amount of people who bring furniture like you mentioned, just keep in mind you’ll have to do something with it at the end of the year (donate it, put it in storage, or take it with you). Because of this and because I like having empty space, I personally keep extra furniture to a minimum. My overall suggestion for you on this would be to bring less than you think and then add what you want as the year goes on.

As far as laundry, you can pretty much do it whenever you’d like. I do laundry once a week and I bring about a week and half worth of normal clothes and then a couple sets of some warm clothes and some formal clothes. The machines aren’t free but they aren’t very expensive either, like roughly 2 bucks each for washing and drying (though they always seem to be going up in price). Worst case if you bring more clothes than you need in the Fall you can just take some back with you over Thanksgiving or Winter break.",3,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,False

3864,3864,m8i6px,grojo66,SCUSKU,"Congrats on the scholarship! That in and of itself is a big accomplishment, and personally I would consider that enough to make the decision. That being said, from the friends I've had in the Civil Engineering program, they all love it because it is a very small and tightly knit group of passionate students. I think you'll find plenty of support, success, and energy from your peers and professors within the Civil Engineering program. Additionally, you can make tons of friends via the dorm you choose to live in (the more social the better, i.e. Swig, Dunne), the clubs/sororities/fraternities you join, and also meeting people through classes. SCU is also a few hours to a bunch of outdoorsy places like Tahoe (skiing), Santa Cruz (surfing), and hiking spots all around in the surrounding hills. Not to mention SF, Carmel, Berkely, etc.

I would say the only downside SCU has compared to a large sized school is smaller facilities and a lack of major sporting events. That said, a new engineering building is currently under construction that is frankly massive, so that problem will go away within a year or so. We would love to welcome you to the Bronco family and I sincerely hope you choose SCU! Congrats!",3,False,False,False,False,False,False,False,True,False,False,False,False,False,False,False
