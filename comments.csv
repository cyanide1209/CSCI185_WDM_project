21,1dbe0b2,l7x780c,Leo_Chen_zy,Have you checked Workday? I think it should be one of the sections under academics. If you can’t find that then registrar’s office is who you’re looking for,1

32,1d91jw1,l7alebd,Sentryion,Can’t you take the train? Scu is right by the station and the path passes Stanford,5
33,1d91jw1,l7b47ei,tm602502,"I didn't mean to sound rude, but the rest of us who have a car may have the same concern as the rental companies: a young driver not familiar with the local roads and traffic looking to ""borrow"" a car for two days. It sounds like a significant liability risk, and the insurance companies may not even cover such a ""borrowing"" event. In case of any incidents, it may put you and the car's owner in a terribly adverse situation. It's almost needless to argue that ""I'm the best driver in the world"" in any sense; even the best drivers will get into accidents. 

I'd suggest the best action is getting a rental car from either ZipCar or other major rental car companies. Indeed, the rental car companies may seem like they charge you the ""underage"" fee upfront, but there are ways to avoid them. For example, you can become an AAA member and then use their discount codes to rent a car to avoid underage fees, etc. I hope this response is helpful to you. We have all been young, and the options were limited at times, but the best you can do is plan your life wisely. 

  
TL;DR: asking to ""borrow"" a car is financially risky for you and the owner.",5
34,1d91jw1,l7abl9f,rubayet1995,Have you tried Turo?,3
35,1d91jw1,l7fdwoa,themexpride,"Public transportation is available. Mix of train, bus, walking, and possibly Uber can save you hundreds of dollars",1
36,1d91jw1,l7q4hwo,1_7_38,"there's a bus line that goes directly from SJC to the santa clara transit center (right next to SCU), from there you can caltrain which stops right next to Stanford. pretty much no walking necessary",1
37,1d91jw1,l7acymv,Substantial_Debt6218,"Sorry, I’m new to the Bay Area, what’s a zip car?",3
38,1d91jw1,l7b8p96,Substantial_Debt6218,"No you’re all good!

I’ve never been to the Bay Area, so I don’t really know much about how rental stuff works.

Luckily, another redditor suggested ZipCar, and I’m going ahead with that.

I totally get how it can be seen as a liability!",1
39,1d91jw1,l7acu0i,Substantial_Debt6218,"Turo is charging me like an extra $100 for young driver, so it’s way out of my budget",1
40,1d91jw1,l7ad657,BaakCoi,It’s a rental car service that lets you rent a car for shorter periods of time. A lot of SCU students use it and get a car for a couple hours to run errands or for day trips,9
41,1d91jw1,l7bg6n1,tm602502,"Based on this page, [https://support.zipcar.com/hc/en-us/articles/220675907-What-are-the-various-fees-charges-I-might-incur](https://support.zipcar.com/hc/en-us/articles/220675907-What-are-the-various-fees-charges-I-might-incur), it actually might cost you more to apply for a ZipCar account and then rent hourly (or daily rate, who knows) while paying their ""underage"" fees. Have you looked into what I recommended? The cheapest AAA membership should cost you $60, and then the major rental car companies will charge you nothing to open an account while waiving your underage fees. 

Let's say in the ZipCar case, you'd have to pay $25 for account application fee + $35 for annual membership fee + underage fee at ZipCar (assuming $15/day), while their daily rental rates are $76, a two-day rental could cost you 25 + 35 + (15+76)\*2 = $242. Gas included. 

  
The AAA + Hertz option may get you: $60 for AAA annual membership fee, and then $143 for two-days rental of a Compact car, and then you're looking at $203 for rental cost (not including gas). Assuming $5/gal gas, the price difference between ZipCar and Hertz option is approximately $39, and that could get you about 8 US gallons of fuel that roughly equals to 200 miles in distance. The advantage about this option is that you will avoid ""underage"" fee anywhere in the country as long as your AAA membership is valid. This may look like a better deal.",3
42,1d91jw1,l7aek9t,Substantial_Debt6218,Do you need to make an appointment beforehand? Or can you just go to one of the stations and get a car?,2
43,1d91jw1,l7ajxc3,BaakCoi,"You have to make an account and get a membership. You can try to get a car immediately, but there’s a chance they’re all reserved, especially on weekends",6

47,1d6rziz,l7boatj,PanickedFish,"Yes, the CS major in CAS requires 3 computer science/engineering classes that you take in the engineering school (CSEN 20 (Embedded Systems), CSEN 21 (Logic Design), & CSEN 177 (Operating Systems)). Additionally, you can take 1-2 CSEN classes as part of your required emphasis for the major. Registering for these courses might be competitive (ie. you might not be able to take a course when you want to because of high demand) but it's not something to worry about too much. If you want to take more CSEN courses then declaring a minor or double major in that department might be an option to consider.",1

56,1d5yi68,l6osuk9,MobilePiano6439,Would love to know also. I visited with my trans kiddo who will be a freshman. I asked several different folks and got different and not great answers. Bottom line was SCU doesn’t have a real plan or process for LGBTQ+ people and housing but they are flexible to provide whatever you request. That seemed like you could get a private room or special bathroom accommodations but not necessarily a trans/ roommate. 🤷🏽‍♀️,4

Correct me if I’m wrong, but I thought when it comes to grad school, the ranking in one specific field is more important than the overall ranking of a uni.(think it’s the other way around with college, like BS degree though) And in this case, ASU has the highest ranking in EECS among these three schools.
On top of that, I’ve heard that the location of a school doesn’t affect on one’s likelihood to get a job nowadays cause companies hire ppl nationwide?🤔 and like there are ASU, NYU and students from different states getting hired in Silicon Valley 🤔",2
83,1d2a3en,l71i2sw,iSezdis,"That is untrue, they have low GPA requirements only because they have less students in AZ and others are deterred by the hot weather. Top AZ students also attend one of the two AZ schools. There are partiers on every campus, including SCU, depends on the majors. The physics, sciences, nursing, pre-med, CS, law and engineering majors are not partying at these AZ campuses. ASU has some highly ranked programs. ASU (Tempe) is 10 degrees hotter than UA (Tucson) and the ASU campus is much larger. But Tempe is a livelier town, the president built it up with restaurants. Tucson has some restaurants within walking distance. ASU students are more sociable, UA students are quiet. ASU has more immigrants and diversity. UA has less diversity and Tucson is a boring town, thus, the students are less sociable and quieter, tend to latch-on to their high school friends. There will be more competition at both AZ schools because they are large, public schools. If you prefer to attend ASU for their ranking in EECS, there could be substantial competition—there is a large population of students from India who attend ASU tech majors. Rankings are overrated too, it depends on the student. SCU in general is a respected school by Silicon Valley employers. We prefer SCU, it's a smaller campus, the weather is beautiful, and it's in Silicon Valley near the tech companies for internships.",0

Reasons he shouldn’t go to NYU

- it’s the MOST expensive university

- lower returns than scu meaning the ROI is drastically worse
- far from home which could be good for them but kind of risky so it depends ig for this

123,1crafji,l3xcnzu,trish199,"My niece applied to both as well, and visited both before deciding. They are VERY different culturally. I would go to the one you feel most aligns to your style.",6
124,1crafji,l3wxkrv,idkcat23,SCU for money alone. Umiami is so expensive.,4
125,1crafji,l3yw4dp,Big_Airline2241,"Go where you would most like to live after graduation. I would say Santa Clara probably has better connections for postgrad jobs, but I also think that is mainly true for people planning to stay in the Bay Area after graduating. UMiami probably has more of a negative party reputation but I'm sure they have way more connections on the east coast/south so it really comes down to where you want to start your life. I would personally choose SCU though, UMiami has always seemed too shallow and flashy (but hey, that might be your style). Also definitely don't just go to UMiami because of the acceptance rate, it literally means nothing these schools are very similar in terms of actual rankings/prestige. Acceptance rate truly means nothing unless you are a spring semester high school senior who wants to show off for a month until everyone realizes it's stupid.",5
126,1crafji,l3z3ynw,fame-so-lame,"Scu without a doubt.  Two things i can promise you based on what u have said.  You’ll have an amazing experience if u stick it out all 4 years and you will also be setting yourself up for life money wise, career wise, etc if u apply yourself, graduate, work hard to set yourself up in whatever you choose to do.  The hard part at first is affording it and getting in so if u have the family ties and can make it work to cover the other 50k cost of tuition or whatever i promise you that you wont regret it.  Oh also the people r awesome so can’t forget that",3
127,1crafji,l42teny,Leather_Special5345,I had the same choice and chose SCU. I'm OOS but have family in bith FL and CA. Santa Clara is more my vibe than Miami (plus it's closer to my home state).,3

132,1cqr2oq,l576uig,Skicrazy85,"I can't speak to your admission chances, once you're in you tend to forget about that and are surrounded only by those that made it in. But the university was great. And it became my home during that time. The cafeteria food is some of the best, but you'll be tired of it by Christmas freshman year. Each dorm has its own personality, I was in Sobrato when I should have been in Swig/Dunn. You'll have small classes and access to all of your professors and they all know what they're talking about very well. Itll be what you make of it. 

The campus has wasted Wednesdays instead of thirsty Thursdays because the business school takes Thursdays off so their students can have internships.

The school distanced themselves from extracurriculars back in the day. So Greek life is off campus and the football team is undefeated for decades.

You'll be friends with people there on scholarships who can barely afford to eat and children of billionaires who shouldn't have gotten in. Avoid the latter.",2

As for course credit, I’m not sure how annoying the civil department is.

Finn, villas, sabrato, and Nobili can be competitive. Roughly in that order.

 Unless you are in a distinguished category like disabled, veteran, lead scholar, etc, the chance of you getting your first or even second or third pick is low. 

They get transfer hopes up by only showing the villa housing but when the time comes, and if housing gets a little tight, they'll throw transfers in a Swig 15×12 with a roommate on the 9th floor and theres not much you can do about it.

It’s pretty similar to other schools except for a having to take a few religious classes and a lot of students come from private catholic high schools. They certainly accept and celebrate people from all religions and backgrounds. I’m sure you will be able to meet other Hindu students, as well as people of any other faith. Im sure more people at SCU are catholic than at non-Catholic schools, but I don’t remember that many people being that religious. Like I didn’t have any friends who went to Church every Sunday. 

As for the religious classes, they’re more the study of religion, it’s not like bible study classes. If you’re concerned about it, I would recommend reaching out to Dr. Tamayo-Moraga, a first year prof who my wife was a teaching assistant for, who specializes in religious diversity and tolerance.

SCU pros- weather, size (if you want small) good business and CS Eng programs, student teacher ratio low, easy to get classes, good airport near campus
SCU cons- expensive tuition, expensive off campus housing, expensive mediocre on campus food in dining halls, no big time athletic programs",4
216,1ciwvbc,l2d5snl,Normiex5,What’s the career choice,3
217,1ciwvbc,l2dagc9,iSezdis,"Depends where you are from. Student should stay in the place where they are from because friends could be from wherever they go to college, that happens. We know a Californian who moved to New York because she missed all her friends from college. There are differences in subcultures, it's good to stay within your subculture, you'll be on the same wavelength. SCU is in Silicon Valley so it's surrounded by tech businesses although with all the layoffs now, it's tough to find internships.

You should know the difference between a private school vs. public school. Private schools have small classes, 5-20, maybe more for general ed classes; professors are accessible during office hours, walkable campus, public schools have TAs teaching, hard to get to speak to the prof at office hours, lines everywhere. But it appears school spirit is big at UConn. SCU has no football team so people go to basketball games. Unsure there is huge school spirit.

Have you visited SCU? The campus is beautiful and the weather is perfect. If you visited during the school year, you would have a better idea of the vibe of the school. My boys love the school, most of the students are well-rounded, both smart and good social skills. Not that rankings mean much, but UConn is #58, SCU is #60 so they are about even. SCU has more expensive tuition although dorm food is mediocre. Because SCU doesn't want to be a commuter school, there is a mandatory 2-year dorm stay and no freshmen parking passes. SCU has a lot of businesses nearby: many diverse restaurants and a Target on El Camino Real, 10 minutes from campus (but you need a car, Zipcar, or Uber). Two malls 10 minutes from campus: [Westfield](https://www.westfield.com/united-states/valleyfair) and [Santana Row](http://www.santanarow.com/), a Safeway grocery store literally across the street from campus, Taco Bell, pizza, wraps, Ike's sandwiches and other eats across the street from campus. Many businesses are on El Camino Real, a 10 minute drive: Chic-Fil-A, Target, Jack-in-the-Box, Korean, Indian, Vietnamese food, check Yelp. Brandin Podziemski just graduated from SCU last year and is playing pro basketball for the Warriors. Religion courses are mandatory but they are mild and there are lots of choices.

SCU doesn't give out much in scholarships and aid like other colleges do, most are paying full tuition. The CalStates and UCs are cheaper tuition so they have more applications than SCU receives. The more applications received and rejected, the lower the admissions rate. Look to the elite and Ivy League schools who encourage students to apply so they can reject them and say they are elite schools. 

SCU is truly a special school that has flown under the radar for years. My sons are loving their time at SCU. Take a tour and check it out for yourself.

SCU's campus is so well-manicured. The differences in campuses are like going to a summer camp vs. a resort.

UCSC Banana Slugs used to be the school with no grades, they are hippies but still Californians. He should tour the campuses while they are in session so he can get the vibe of the students, they are almost opposite.

UC's are huge. UC and CalState students know that it will be 5 years till graduation because it's so impacted that it's difficult to get classes. This has been going on since the 1980s. Everything is a fight: food lines, class registration, etc. And yes, UCs have TAs teaching and lines a mile long to speak to the professor, versus SCU, where the professors are easily accessible during office hours and answer emails.

SCU is a beautiful campus. Because SCU doesn't want to be a commuter school, there is a mandatory 2-year dorm stay and no freshmen parking passes. SCU has a lot of businesses nearby: many diverse restaurants and a Target on El Camino Real, 10 minutes from campus (but you need a car, Zipcar, or Uber). Two malls 10 minutes from campus: [Westfield](https://www.westfield.com/united-states/valleyfair) and [Santana Row](http://www.santanarow.com/), a Safeway grocery store literally across the street from campus, Taco Bell, pizza, wraps, Ike's sandwiches and other eats across the street from campus. 

Your son should tour both campuses while they are in session and feel the vibe of the student population. SCU has smaller classes than UCs and the professors are accessible. Maybe he can shadow with a business student for a day. 

If UCSC has no business school and that is his major, it seems silly to chose that campus. Most schools have business majors, he didn't get accepted into any other schools? Arizona State?

I can't speak to the career information but SCU is a reputable engineering college and at Pomona you would be commuting for ***an hour*** and will get less college campus experience. College is a time to mature and gain experiences, not just a means to an end for a career and it is located in Silicon Valley. You visited while school was in session and appreciated the vibe of the school and people, that is important. The classes at SCU are small so there is access to professors while most CA public schools make that difficult. My son is enjoying SCU as a CAS major and he's got a lot of extracurriculars, not that CAS is easy, people do drop out. CalPoly is your typical public CA college campus, not a nice as SCU's. CPP was originally a commuter school. SCU requires two years of dorm living because they don't want to be a commuter school. They also don't allow freshmen parking passes. I suggest you reach out to students in your major at both colleges to help your decision. CalPoly could be more hands-on, that's what they claim. You seem like a nice kid for not wanting to burden your parents. Also find out how long it takes to graduate—CA public schools are so impacted that most take 5 years to graduate because they can't get all their classes.

It's hard to get the first internship so you can start at a small company. Once you have an internship experience on your resume, you will get another better internship much much easier.  Ultimately, you will get a developer job in a big company. 

To get an internship, try to approach many alumni who are working in high tech companies and invite them for a coffee chat. You can use LinkedIn to approach them.",2

351,1c7nns0,l0hi1p3,WuPeter6687298,"No worry. The first step is to write a professional software developer resume, which needs 3 projects in details. You can get these projects easily by taking an Udemy course. Udemy courses are usually on sales for like $15 per course. Just take one popular course like Web Development Bootcamp by Angela Yu. Code along with the course. Write projects in details on your resume. Link the websites you make to your projects on your resume. 

These projects will attract HR more than what courses you take in SCU because projects show your experience on what you can do. 

Your resume and LinkedIn profile are also important. You can ask senior students who have already worked as interns in Software developers to review them and give you advice on how to improve them. You may gift them a box of chocholate and they will be happy to help you. 

SCU has the best location for software developers but you need to use the location to gain real industrial experiences.

I live 20 minutes from campus so unfortunately, cannot advise on a hotel (there's no huge, obvious one  besides the [Sonesta Suites](https://www.yelp.com/biz/sonesta-simply-suites-silicon-valley-santa-clara-santa-clara) that is directly across the street). The SJC airport is only 10 minutes from campus. Google ""scu where to stay hotels"" and a lot pop up. Also, SCU's website has information: [SCU travel & accommodations](https://www.scu.edu/search/?q=hotels) If you choose not to rent a car, there are two nice shopping malls so close to campus (50 minute walk, 10 minute drive). Indoor mall: [Westfield/Valley Fair](https://www.westfield.com/united-states/valleyfair) Outdoor mall across the street from Westfield: [Santana Row](http://www.santanarow.com/) There is a hotel at Santana Row so you could keep busy while your kids are at SCU.

My son is enjoying his time at SCU. It's a beautiful campus, it feels like a resort and the weather is unbeatable. The classes are small and all are recorded if you are sick and can't make it to class. The professors are accessible during office hours and most do reply to emails. It's a small campus so it won't take long to see.

We have found that many of the students are very balanced, they are smart yet have good social skills. There are geeks too but it's not full of them like some campuses (UC Berkeley, etc.). Being Jesuit, they focus on the full person, not just academics. There is a two-year mandatory dorm stay and freshmen aren't allowed parking passes—they want students to interact and not be a commuter school—that said, students can petition for special circumstances, usually mental health issues. And if you aren't religious, NBD, the religion classes are mild and there are many options.

My only advice is to make friends ASAP because there is no student orientation so the only way to make friends is to be pro-active. My son joined a frat and is on a club sports team so he has his connections but I have read that there are lonely students at SCU (as there are at all campuses). Especially with technology keeping kids antisocial and inside their rooms (on every campus, not just SCU), there needs to be an effort to make friends these days. Back in my day, we all kept our dorm doors open and had parties with beer, it was a great way to connect but there is too much overdrinking these days, colleges don't allow drinking and students keep their dorm doors closed. There is no rule about keeping the doors closed (like there is at Chapman. The RA actually told students they couldn't keep their doors open due to being a fire hazard!). And BTW, between Chapman and SCU, hands-down SCU. Chapman is a joke school for tuition hoarding, SCU is a real school that deserves its good reputation and students can progress onto Ivy League grad schools if they choose.",3

The question is: Can a person get a scholarship money from ***ED?*** My son had a very strong application in CS but was declined EA yet we know others who had lesser applications and were offered EA. It's no guarantee as you seem to imply. It depends on so many things: How many apply who are URMs, D1 athletes, Ivy League applications, Catholics, unique talents, certain ethnicity, etc.

SCU doesn't protect their yield, meaning, they will offer EA to applicants that they know will decline and go to an Ivy League if admitted (an SCU admissions director told me). That's why they added EDII a few years ago, so people get a second chance. EA before COVID was easier and used as intended (you strongly want to attend the school but don't want to commit). After COVID, things got shaken up and the top students are applying ***everywhere*** and this affects SCU applications as well, they get the EA offers even though they aren't serious about SCU. With each passing year, SCU receives more applications. Some colleges have outright eliminated EA because it's no longer being used as intended, students are all just applying EA.

I have also lived in SJ most of my life. I was not used to the absolute hikes I had to do just to get to class at UCSC. I also have bad knees so that made it worse. I missed the flatness of SCU lol.

Housing is really bad in Santa Cruz. I lived at home and drove over 17 twice a day to get my degree. I missed out on social things because oftentimes I was so tired I just wanted to go home.

Class size isn't too big at UCSC, but I was a transfer so maybe upper div was different. I do remember one philosophy class in the auditorium that had a bunch of people but otherwise, most of my classes were kind of seminar-sized amounts of people... max 30?

I'm not sure re: sciences because I was an English major in junior college and transferred in for legal studies (which, tbh, also very small program, so that could be why I had smaller classes). But I don't see why UC would give an edge over SCU on biology.

At the end of the day I'd consider what you feel comfortable with financially. I ended up graduating with under 10k in federal loans for all of undergrad because I did junior college and sped through UCSC, but I also missed out on some of the typical college experiences. SCU would be more of a typical experience but it's a lot more expensive.

Good luck!",6

I grew up in San Jose and SCU was my top school. However, while waiting for acceptance letters (transfer; spent two years at CC) I had TAG and decided to check out UCSB. Absolutely loved it when I visited and decided that weekend I was going to go there. I ended up getting into SCU but I spent my undergrad at SB. It was the time of my life and it gave me the experience of living somewhere new. 

I’ve been back in the Bay for 8 years and now getting my MBA at SCU. But I got the opportunity to live by the beach, hike beautiful mountains, explore a new town and area, study at a coastal university, and have a ton of fun in my carefree 20’s. Santa Clara is the safe, comfortable bet, but it’ll always be here for you. My advice is to go out into the world and explore and try new experiences. Come back here for your masters if that’s still what you want to do when you graduate.",5

I was scared that I would regret my decision at first but I ended up enjoying SCU a lot! The bio dept is pretty great  and there’s tons of opportunities to get involved in research. I was able to join a research lab during spring quarter of my freshman year. I was also able to graduate in 3 years because I always got into the classes that I wanted, which might not be as doable at a UC. Feel free to message me if you have any questions!",3
430,1c22i9j,kzaywa2,asessdsssssssswas,I’ve taught at both. My students graduating scu seem to be more successful now. A lot more. Most had a better starting point tho. But scu has a lot more opportunities for students in the form of connections and internships and stuff,3
431,1c22i9j,kzbc0yn,iSezdis,"""UC Santa Cruz's campus it looks amazing."" Don't quite understand this statement. My child went to a sports camp at UCSC and the campus is like camping, the dorms were crap old, and it's amongst huge trees, seems like a campsite. SCU's campus is so well-manicured. The differences in campuses are like going to a summer camp vs. a resort.

As far as staying in the area where you grew up, going away to experience a different region is overrated unless it's a big city school. You are talking about two campuses which are only 40 minutes apart in distance. UCSC Banana Slugs used to be the school with no grades, they are hippies but still Californians. Unless you are a hippie, you might like SCU better. Going away to a college in a city would be a different experience.

UC's are huge. UC and CalState students know that it will be 5 years till graduation because it's so impacted that it's difficult to get classes. This has been going on since the 1980s. Everything is a fight: food lines, class registration, etc. And yes, UCs have TAs teaching and lines a mile long to speak to the professor, versus SCU, where the professors are easily accessible during office hours and answer emails.

Guessing you are pre-med? Did you think of going to a school that has a med school like UCD? Maybe SCU has an affiliation with a hospital for pre-meds.",3
432,1c22i9j,kzcazrt,salemochi,"Yeah, campus buildings suck unless you're in the newest engineering buildings. The nature is pretty, sure, but during my time at UCSC there were legitimate concerns that there may be lead in the drinking water. Porter college smells like sewers. Buses are often late and you need to use those to get around campus because half the time there's not even a sidewalk to go where you need. The buses are about 30 years old, not well maintained, and a bus driver died in December after the bus he was driving malfunctioned and crashed into the side of a hill. 4/20 last year, some students very publicly celebrated H*tler's birthday with a birthday cake. I think a few months ago a student was murdered on the beach by her boyfriend who was kicked out of the school. So ... yeah.

By comparison, the only murder I can remember at SCU was the dorm stabbing ~10 years ago.",1

For diversity, there are many students with financial aid and scholarships but many do pay full tuition. So if you are even thinking that it might be too elite for you, then maybe it is. You should tour the campus and look at the students instead of asking reddit strangers. Many are wealthy but they aren't snooty. If you want to crawl into a cave because you see nice cars and students ordering via Doordash all the time, then attend a public college instead. 

It's all about you, do you feel confident enough to hangout with all or do you get intimidated? Not talking about families with private jets, but families who can afford to pay full tuition. There is wealth but it's a liberal school, they don't have outright entitled attitudes like they would look down upon others. Not everyone is loaded so you will find your own.

535,1busy9q,kylzfsa,Real-male-,"There is a huge difference between the two. Go tour before summer break so you can get a feel for the people and campus. UCB is next to crime-infested Oakland where businesses are leaving due to the high crime. UCB has homeless all over campus. UCB has anti-semitism yet they are a far-left school. SCU is definitely a safer place to be. I wouldn't go to UCB if I were offered, it's too huge, the area is dangerous and the students are weird, they are too geeky because they had their head in the books in high school. Housing is an issue too, it's only guaranteed for freshman year at UCB. SCU has a mandatory 2-year dorm stay and no freshmen parking passes. UCB is so large that you have to fight for everything including classes and food. Since the '80s people have known that you cannot graduate from a UC or CalState in 4 years because you can't get your classes because of too many students. So plan for 5 years of tuition at UCB. Also, SCU is the quarter system of 10 week classes, UCB is the semester system. People go for the prestige of UCB but without test scores now, the prestige factor is sliding. They are trying to admit more minorities, which is the reason for the no-test scores rule. And college honors programs at schools are not worthwhile. Plenty of intelligent students at SCU, you don't need an honors program to find intelligent people like you may at other colleges. Employers don't give a hoot about honors programs. SCU has professors while UCB is a research school so the professors don't teach, there are TAs teaching in their huge classes while SCU has classes of 6-20 students and the professors are accessible during office hours.

There was even Early Decision II in January and you didn't apply then, either. You would have had a better chance of admission because they are more lenient in ED admissions because they are guaranteed students so it's easier for their planning.

Find your admissions counselor and write to them: [SCU Admissions Counselors](https://www.scu.edu/admission/contact-us/findyourcounselor/) You are better off writing as soon as possible to show urgent intent. In that Letter of Continued Interest, you can describe your community service experience that you will be doing in April. You can even include a contact person for them to confirm. Visiting school events won't matter at this point because it's not documented.

Know that some people will not be able to afford the tuition and will decline their offers so you probably have a good chance. Perhaps the SCU counselor might be able to tell you where you are on the wait list or give you other information.

What's more important is, which school do you prefer? Did you tour both campuses while they are in session? You can feel the vibe of the students if you tour and that can be helpful. SoCal people are different than NorCal people. USC is gated because it's in a ghetto. When you have to find off-campus housing, you'll be in a  ghetto. SCU is a safer area, there is a Safeway grocery store across from campus (although USC has Trader Joe's on campus). SCU has nearby food off-campus. But there are more activities to do in Los Angeles.

Gavin Newsom ’89, governor, California; former lieutenant governor, California; former mayor, San Francisco (city’s youngest mayor in a century); former host, The Gavin Newsom Show

Ironically, coming from Northern California, I have never heard about SCU, except when I googled the governors, that’s when I recognized and remembered SCU.

And Santa Clara University has one of the highest student income in the U.S., higher than Berkeley and USC, not by a wide margin tho.

For example, SCU biology, Poli-sci, Psychology, student has higher median salary than Berkeley and USC within the same major. Of course, some students at Berkeley and USC outperform SCU in some other areas too, but on average, SCU student comparatively earn more wages than Berkeley and USC if you compare major-by-major salaries. 

But I was surprised, in this website, SCU is on-par with Stanford, maybe it’s due to limited sample size.

UCD is HUGE and flat with 31,000 undergrads (need a bike) and SCU is smaller (6000 undergrads) and beautifully landscaped. UCD weather is hotter but it's closer to skiing in the winter. UCD is so crowded that classes will be more difficult to get (most UC students need 5 years to graduate because they can't get their classes) and there will be long lines for cafeteria food. SCU has a mandatory 2-year dorm requirement and doesn't allow freshmen to get parking passes—they don't want to be a commuter school. UCD probably has more international students. My son studies CS at SCU but I am familiar with UCD, my husband attended there and got tired of having to fight for everything, thus, we didn't send any of our kids to UCs. UCD has more of a long history of strong biological sciences. SCU is more known for their business school but has good tech education too.

The SJC airport is only a 10-minute ride from SCU.

* Don't let the rankings cloud your judgement. Let me tell you about the USN&WR rankings: they are mostly based upon endowments, which is why the Ivy Leagues are ranked the highest. And a Columbia professor wrote an analysis of the rankings, accusing his own school of submitting statistics that were “inaccurate, dubious or highly misleading."" The rankings can also be gamed. Northeastern's [How Northeastern Gamed the College Rankings](https://www.bostonmagazine.com/news/2014/08/26/how-northeastern-gamed-the-college-rankings/) [Northeastern's Rise in the Rankings](https://www.ivycoach.com/the-ivy-coach-blog/the-rankings/northeasterns-rise-in-the-rankings/)
* Social life? I don't know that it's better at BU. Apparently, the weather is so bad that people end up staying inside and partying.
* SCU has a very large indoor mall with a food court and a nice outdoor mall only 5 minutes away and many options for food across from campus as well as a grocery store. There's also a Target, and other fast food places nearby.
* SCU does mandate two years of staying in the dorm and no parking passes for freshmen, as they don't want it to be a commuter school. 
* My oldest son attended BU for a summer camp and the administration was very incompetent (in 2013). It didn't seem like a private school at all. And with over 37,000 students, it's more like a public school. SCU is 9000 total students.
* BU's Warren Towers is about the same as SCU's Swig Hall, both have no air conditioning and there is humidity in Boston. There are choices to live in other newer dorms, however.
* BU is known for ***grade deflation*** (look it up), a thought if you want to attend grad school.
* It has been said that East Coasters use BU as a back-up school if they don't get into the Ivies.

My advice: Whichever you choose, be sure to focus on making friends the first week of school because if you miss that boat, your experience will not be as enjoyable.",1

But don’t get fooled by the salary placements because Santa Clara and Boston are having both High Cost of Living so the wages are of course higher.

Stanford and Berkeley outcompete Santa Clara in the bay area. 

Harvard, MIT, Columbia, and maybe NYU outcompete BU in the northeast.",1

I live in Silicon Valley and know that many employers do not hire Stanford grads because they are too arrogant and want to lead while SCU students roll up their sleeves and are ready to learn. To be admitted to those highly ranked schools, they had to jump through a lot of hoops, check a lot of boxes, so they have a different work ethic and outlook on life. There was even an article written about it, that the graduates from the top schools aren't all that impressive. We know students who attend Stanford (and Ivies) and they are no smarter than other well-ranked schools like UCB, SCU, USC; they merely groomed their applications or had a connection for admission. Being academically successful for admittance to those schools doesn't equate with being successful in life—attending those schools is overrated. Most of our parents in our school district are academically successful and they have no common sense and are not street smart, they are only book smart so they are dumb in a different way.

Babson is very good for entrepreneurship from what I have heard and its well respected by firms in boston. Same goes with Northeastern and their co-op program. SCU, Babson, and NEU will all be very good for landing internships, if that is a concern for you. I don't know as much about Purdue's business school but I have heard good things about it.

I also took Honors classes, particularly in more general studies like English and Social Studies; there was a separate Honors division within the business school that I was also a part of, but it was distinct from the University-wide program. That meant classes comprised solely of other Honors students and they were usually small in class size (<20?) and more discussion-oriented in nature.

Basketball and soccer get most of the attention but I feel like we aren’t super known for athletic, but they are fun to go to.
2. I would consider SCU to be somewhat of a party school, Greek life isn’t associated with the school and there are definitely frats about every week, and a lot of people throw personal parties.
3. Student life is really what you make it to be. The type of people you surround yourself with will make your student culture here. I’ve met people who are not super serious about relationships and people who are, so just depends on who you’re around, same goes for your social life.
4. The support at this school is pretty good in my opinion. Depending on the major it does differ but so much academic support is available you just have to look for it and use it.
5. I would say we lean more liberal.

793,1bi4rbl,kvongjx,DLineHopeful,dawg how the fuck,1
794,1bi4rbl,kvotsu2,Lost-Obligation,Cause i didn’t apply EA and I think that is important.  Wasn’t one of my top choices but have not had luck with UCs.  I saw someone with a 4.0/4.8 who got into UCLA get waitlisted here also.  I just wrote a really good LOCI and I’ve heard good things about getting off the waitlist with good LOCIs so 🤞.,1
795,1bi4rbl,kxu7bai,iSezdis,"That UCLA acceptance is because the UCs only care about the GPA. Someone currently at UCB looked at her application and it showed that the two readers took only 2 minutes each on her application, it showed the sign in times and the sign out times. 

SCU looks more for the whole person, their extracurriculars and personal essays so they take longer in reviewing. Notice that the GPAs they accept are not the 4.0+ because they don't want students who studied too much and didn't develop their social skills. Jesuit is about the whole person. That is what we like about SCU students, they are very balanced. There are geeks too, but for the most part, the students are smart but with good social skills too. 

Don't kick yourself for not EAing. EA used to be easier but EA changed after COVID lockdowns. Students who would normally apply only to the top schools (ie: Ivy and elite) started applying ***everywhere*** so it screwed up things for EA. We were told that in our year, SCU had 1000 applications with 4.0 GPAs, the most ever for them so they gave them the EA offers even though they knew they were the back-up school—they don't protect their yield! So basically, the only guarantee for SCU is ED or EDII or take your chances on regular admissions. But the fact that UCs don't release their decisions until after the January EDII deadline makes it difficult. 

Someone once told us that if you state you will pay full price tuition, that helps. I do not know if this is true but most people are paying full-price except Catholics, underrepresented minorities, need-based, and the very few merit scholarships. SCU is stingy with giving out money vs. some other colleges.",1

835,1bf62mi,kuz3yl3,Futurebass_Guy919,"This is an unpopular opinion, but I think Campisi is one of the best dorms for freshman/sophomore year, for reasons you might not think about. I liked Campisi for the media room(we would hook up DJ equipment), location in the center of campus near Benson, but most importantly, the layout allowed for a great community. 

On the second floor there is a big lounge area, and people would always be hanging out in the lounge because your room is just a standard 2 person dorm and is small. Because of that, you really get to know everyone in your dorm fairly quickly, and it almost feels like frat/sorority by the end of it if you engage with people. Some of my greatest memories are from doing random shit with random people in the dorm, and my best friends on Campus to date are people I met on the 2nd floor of Campisi. 

So to sum it up, Campisi is good because of the design that promotes community, since the other dorms don't have a large common area/are more set up like ""suites"" where you share a 8 person ""mini house"" basically.",3

892,1b4ait8,ksxrcan,LS4delorean,"100% agree. I complained about this already in my first year in 2018. The mech dept chair at the time shot down my request for a baja sae multiple times. I don’t recommend to anyone to waste so much money coming to this school. I got machine shop internships for hands on experience. 

Social life is great though if you join non-stem social life (club sports, greek life)

*to add on: big companies don’t know SCU by name. It has no reputation unless you’re local to the area. A Navy Officer recruiter thought I said Santa Clarita multiple times. The only companies that routinely hire SCU mech E’s locally are Critchfield mechanical and some other HVAC. If you want to get into the industry you want, start reaching out to people on linkedin who work there. Everyone I know who got a job after graduating had an inside connection.

901,1b46yck,kszmscr,Futurebass_Guy919,"Since you mentioned serving in the marines, you might want to steer clear of the Bay Area imho. In my experience at Santa Clara, people typically have a negative view of the military and the honor that comes with it, so you’ll have to be cool with some people being kinda rude if you mention anything about the military, and they will turn it in to an opportunity to ask whether or not you think the military is morally right or some shit based on some of the stuff America has been involved with in the last century in foreign countries. I don’t really like this, because some kids here can’t separate the idea that the “system” has caused damage in some counties, and it’s wrong to judge an individual soldier following orders since he is not responsible for the questionable military operations that resulted in some geopolitical consequences, the generals who sent them there are. An example of this is when I told a classmate of mine that I want to serve in the Navy, and he responded with, “so you wanna kill 3rd world children?” I was just kinda like huh? Bro I think most people in the military are not murdering 3rd world children, and I was just sort of taken a back because where I come from you don’t disrespect people in the military like that and reduce their service to murder. Idk, that’s just the vibe I picked up being here for 3 years, so just be aware that some people here WILL judge you for serving the nation we all live in, even though you filled a spot so they could be here in Santa Clara thinking they are some “morally superior” pacifist or some bullshit like that.",2
902,1b46yck,kszo7ce,Futurebass_Guy919,"But I will say I am biased because I just don’t fit in here being from Dallas, and after spending 3 years here I’ve sorta realized that there is nowhere on campus where I feel like I naturally “belong” based on my hobbies, personality, and moral/political beliefs(very few, I hate politics mostly). So take what I say with a grain of salt, because I’m not exactly satisfied with Santa Clara, so I have a more negative take on the social life here based on just a lot of people who have generally  treated me like shit here.",-1
903,1b46yck,kt41pn6,PrintOk8045,"I mean, you're going to be 6 years older than a lot of people and at least a couple years older than the seniors, which definitely makes you an outlier. You might want to hang with the grad students or the law students, but you'll still be older than most of them. Maybe join a church with a young adults study group, or an adult rec sports league, motorcycle club, car club, Kiwanis, Toastmasters, VFW, or if you're into politics, the local branch of your favorite party. That's likely to have people closer to your age and life experience.

I'm also wondering if you'll have much in common with people 6 years younger than you. When you enlisted, they were in 6th grade. I'm trying to think if I've ever hung out with people 6 years younger than me and I'm pretty sure the answer is no.

I feel like the ROTC, frat, rugby, hockey, men’s frisbee circles generally wanted to have fun and didn’t participate in the bs.

915,1au84ej,krdor8q,-lmayonnaise-,The gpa range is 3.7-3.97 for college of engineering admissions. The posted acceptance rate of 44% is false—that’s a combo rate of all three schools.

My understanding tho is that at SCU, admissions counselors have nothing to do with faculty/profs; they’re assigned by school district/region. So maybe they’re hired through those channels.

924,1au616q,kr22xsc,letusc4968,"I work at the front desk of benson, so when you call Santa Clara you’re calling the line that I pick up so I definitely have a perspective on this.

1. for student jobs I can agree that some positions could be overstaffed but I’m pretty sure it comes from a place of trying to provide as many on campus jobs as possible for students. SCU is expensive and I know a lot of people work to help pay for school. So yes it might seemed overstaffed but as a student I appreciate being able to have a job.
2. I love my manager! What we do at the desk isn’t super regulated, but for the benson desk and most others we are doing homework. It’s a lot of sitting and answering the phone and helping people who walk up. I personally think we do a good job at respecting and paying attention to people walking up especially as the main info desk. As for any student desk job I guarantee they will be doing homework because there is a lot of just sitting and waiting. Someone taking a personal call while talking to you shouldn’t happen so hopefully that’s the only time!

What is more likely is the game the ref was supposed to work was forfeited, and there was just extra time in between the next game. This happens a lot, why should it matter to you if an IM ref is on their phone 😭",8
926,1au616q,kr3svr7,themexpride,"SCU probably overstaffs and overpays admin at best. Many faculty and staff still struggle to live in a HCOL area and commute to work every day. How SCU spends their money is something you can't control and many are fine with it since students continue to apply and accept to come to SCU. If you're concerned about your money being wasted on terrible investments, you're better off finishing your classes at another MBA program.

Try not to compare student jobs to other lines of work. SCU operates on another system with a set of unique student workers. They hire on a minimum wage. They also don't provide benefits and if they do, they're small perks. Your tuition money isn't being wasted on student jobs. It's probably being spent on buying more bonds and stocks to ""keep it running."" 

I did my homework and worked simultaneously. It's normal at SCU. If you had a terrible service, then I would've just confronted them. I never had an experience like yours and if I did, I wouldn't have let it slide. As for calls, context matters and it's more evident when dealing with customer-facing roles that have an external phone line. The worker probably doesn't know how to work too well and I always assume it's a first job for many. I'm just open minded and patient.

You missed out on the fact that many students work to receive the work-study grants they receive from the federal government. Many of those hires are saving SCU thousands and thus, that's why they prefer to hire them over non-work-study students who probably have a better work ethic.

In terms of work ethic, I doubt you'll see any improvement overall. I don't expect any positive values from the younger generations. They are indifferent these days about work and others. Each generation has their set of problems and this one you're dealing with is all about themselves.

Dunno if you want to consider transferring since you're concerned about a terrible ROI from your MBA experience. Most of your questions can be boiled down to (confronting terrible service), (minding your business if it doesn't directly affect you), (transferring to another MBA program). Every university has their fair set of issues. Choose the one that you can justify going to.",1
927,1au616q,kr39y5d,iSezdis,"Customer service has gone way downhill. I worked in retail and the restaurant business in the '80s when employees were more professional. The customer standing in front of you was always priority over phone calls.

I suggest you interrupt instead of being polite and waiting since it is their job to help, and always do it with a smile so it doesn't come off as rude. Sometimes I will smile and be pleasant and apologize (fake) and say I'm in a real hurry and have to meet someone and then pretend to be grateful. You must start learning some sales/marketing skills to deal with these idiots.

Also, you cannot judge an entire campus of students based upon the few deficient ones. It could be that the ones who need to get jobs have parents who made poor financial decisions so they cannot foot the entire bill for their kid's college. The more responsible students perhaps do not need to work.",-1

So bigger companies tend to overstaff, and allow workers to slack off. But it's not fair to their customers.  Where private small company managers care because it's the other way around. I had remote jobs, most of which consisted of tutoring. Tutoring does not allow any downtime, that's the nature of the job. I was an undergrad research assistant at UCD and my work was remote. However, the supervisor just told me to clock in my hours whenever I work and I was honest about it. I definitely felt like I could have been dishonest about it and still gotten away with it, but I knew that was wrong. But I never had ""downtime."" I worked at Stanford university in the last year, this was a full time remote job, and whenever I did not have work the manager said I can just do whatever and still clock my hours when I didn't have work. I still pretended to do work, looked over data sets, different systems, learned more about the university cause I felt an ethical responsibility to do so. But I didn't do that for 8 hours a day, but I did whatever I could that wasn't a complete waste of time when I thought it could benefit the company in some shape of way, But I only did not do work, when I really had no work and whatever I did would just be a complete waste of time. I was working in private sector before.",-1
929,1au616q,kr2c3gs,Wonderful_Ad6675,"Well see, instead of overstaffing they can just lower the students tuition. It's not fair to the students who pay that tuition just to pay the student workers to do their homework. The tuition is so high because they need to pay their staff. The best solution would be to lower the tuition and get rid of jobs they don't need.  That's just my opinion.   
I feel like universities are more lax in terms of not being strict with their employees. But i've worked in private sector and they are a lot more strict. Like if it was just a lot of sitting around, they'd make you pretend to do work for the full shift, or do nothing for the full shift. They wouldn't let you do hw like that on the clock",-5

940,1atfxmw,kqy4ixw,Present_Constant1264,"1. TLDR: Greek life is pretty decently prominent, and it is especially prominent if you plan on partying a lot. If you're a guy, you kind of need to be in a frat if you wanna party. I am not in a frat, neither are most of my close friends, but I have a lot of friends that are. Sigma Pi, Cal Phi, TKE, Sigma Chi, and Pike are the main ones, while ZBT, Kappa Sigma, and Phi Delta Theta have sizable presences, (kind of in that order, but that's debatable lol). They each have their own little personality. When I was in high school, I really wanted to be in a frat, but then I got to college and realized I don't really fit in with them. Hazing can be brutal depending on the frat, and can last as long as 18 weeks. If you don't like ""partying"" meaning you don't like drinking, drugs, loud music, trash, hazing, staying up all night, then probably don't rush IMO. I have a lot of friend in Cal Phi and the stories they tell me of hazing are hilarious but also horrible. A lot of vomit, a lot of all nighters. But then again, frats kind of have a monopoly on partying. If you want to party regularly as a guy, then you kind of need to be in a frat. Frat parties are usually closed to guys, meaning only other frat brothers are allowed. The other options are going to local bars (the hut, bronco) or going clubbing in SJ or SF. I also have friends in frats who say that rushing a frat was the best decision they've ever made, and pledging was the best time of their life. That they really found a brotherhood in fraternities. There are a lot of parties during week 1 of fall quarter. Go out a bunch, go to all of the frats, meet the brothers, see who you vibe with the most.
2. TDLR: Santa Clara is decently diverse, but west coast is definitely the majority. Californians definitely make up the biggest group of people here, followed by people from the PNW. There is a good number of midwest/east coast people though. I'm from California but almost all of my friends are from NY, Boston, or Chicago. Couple from Portland and Seattle, with a few Bay Area locals. I also know a few people from Wisconsin, St. Louis, Ohio, Florida, Texas. There are also a lot of international students, mainly from Asia but some Europeans and South Americans.",2
941,1atfxmw,kqxweav,New-Pollution3778,What major,1
942,1atfxmw,kr3fh1z,Real-male-,"Males cannot get into evening frat parties. Females can attend frat parties. The SCU TKE is not a ""good"" one, they are not very choosy. SAE got their charter removed so they started CalPhi. PIKEs, CalPhi are the meatheads with more challenging hazing. ZBT is the most ethnically diverse (meaning more than two non-whites). Kappa Sigma and Phi Delt are small. The bottom line is to choose whichever guys you feel most comfortable with, nobody cares about the reputations—it's not like the huge colleges where there are clearly ""top"" frats with all the rich jocks.

There are darties which are open day parties for everyone during the first couple of weeks of the quarters. Check social media to find them, although many of them don't update, it's kind of word-of-mouth. I suppose you can look up their house addresses, ha. They all do a lot of drinking, not necessarily drugs; if you can't drink a lot, a frat is ***not*** for you, you won't get through the pledging period. SCU is not affiliated with the Greeks, they don't want the liability but it doesn't seem to affect anything. SCU students aren't the frat idiots that can be found on other large campuses.

While it's nice to be in a frat so you'll always have someone to hang with and a party each week, there are school clubs, intramural sports, and other ways to meet people. Frats are certain personalities and are not for everyone, there are only 8 at SCU (maybe 500 members) amongst an undergrad population of 6000.

Try to meet people in your dorm from the get-go when no one has friends yet because it gets tougher after the first week, and this is true of all colleges.",2

948,1atfxmw,kr811jq,iSezdis,"Ha, that is the point of joining a frat, for brotherhood. There are darties where everyone is invited, even other frat members. They are usually at the beginning of the quarter. There aren't many house parties because usually those are the people who join frats. No, males cannot pay to get into a regular, night party but girls are always invited. The reason that frat parties are more restricted now is due to sexual assault claims, they don't want outsiders to ruin their reputations, they trust their own members (although there have been some claims). At darties, everyone knows that anyone is invited so the frats aren't liable.",2

Have a good day!",3
951,1asx6yg,kr0yu04,-lmayonnaise-,"You’re going to be switching entire schools, so unfortunately it’s not easy and you won’t be able to do it asap. Switching majors within a school is easy, but switching from Leavey to college of engineering or CAS is a different story. You’ll have to establish excellent grades your freshman year (I believe they don’t even consider anyone with lower than 3.5) and you’ll have to apply and write some essays most likely, unless they changed the process recently and it’s different now then when friends of mine did it a few years ago. The acceptance rate for switching schools is probably around 30%. Keep in mind, you’re basically going to have a bunch of business classes that are gonna be largely useless in the other schools and may have to redo some GE classes. I’d recommend having a serious conversation with a CS advisor and make a 4 year plan for your transfer before you make this decision.",3
952,1asx6yg,kr1pzmf,Real-male-,"Paid college counselors often advise this for students applying to private schools if they think it's too difficult to get admitted into the major they really want. My college counselor advised this but I didn't want to lie. I got into CAS and am glad that I didn't lie, no stress. CalPoly SLO doesn't allow anyone to transfer depts. once they are admitted to their school and this is probably why, they need to know how many to admit into each department. At UCSB, they have to take some CS classes to prove that they can pass the classes before they allow them to transfer in, it's tougher to transfer into CS at the public schools. Maybe after the second year at SCU it will be easier to transfer into CAS after people have dropped out of the major, and this does occur, it's a challenging major.",4
953,1asx6yg,kquehb8,Ambitious_Growth_587,Actually I believed that it’s easier to get into through this major and computer science has got too much competition. So my idea behind this was that MIS is the closest to CS and so it’ll help me transfer to CS once in much more easily,2

Exactly why I told my counsellor I'll apply to only COEN and go wherever I get in.",2
956,1asx6yg,kr0zxdq,-lmayonnaise-,"There’s no such thing. Your only option if you want to stay in Leavey would be to double major, but MIS is already a really big major so you’d need to overload/take summer school in order to finish in 4 years.",1

So that means that one department oversees MIS in Leavey and CS and CE in the other schools. Economics has the same thing for example—the Econ department covers both Econ in Leavey and Econ in college of arts and sciences. So truly, there is no CS and CE in Leavey, only MIS. [HERE](https://www.scu.edu/business/undergraduates/academics/majors-and-minors/) is the full list of majors and minors at Leavey, to help eliminate confusion.",1
960,1asx6yg,kr1193t,Ambitious_Growth_587,"Hm, it’s clear now… so what should I do if I want to get into CS like I talked to an alumni from SCU and he told me to try to transfer into CS before regular decisions . Suppose I try to transfer if such thing is possible and I do not get it, so will my current MIS admission will also be rejected?",1
961,1asx6yg,kr12ayz,-lmayonnaise-,"No no, certainly not. Your current admission status will not be affected at all if you apply for a transfer in any circumstances. It may be possible to switch before beginning the school year, but personally, I doubt it. But definitely worth asking, it doesn’t hurt to contact someone and find out! In order to be CS, you’d be transferring into college of engineering. [Here](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/undergraduate/internal-transfer/) is the internal transfer website with all the information you should need. Based on the website, the soonest you can apply to transfer is spring quarter of their first year. However, I would recommend contacting the department asap and finding out about any possibilities before hand, though like I said, I doubt they will oblige.",2

967,1asx6yg,kr1o2bk,Real-male-,"If you are correct, that it's not so easy, that is a good system by SCU. I have heard about people who apply under a different major to private schools so they will be admitted but have the intention of changing majors once admitted.  It's the paid college counselors who advise it. It's unfair to the school because they need to know their numbers when reviewing applications. If suddenly, all the history majors want to  transfer into CS, it messes up their numbers.",2

969,1asxsyu,kquwga6,malinny,"I’ve replied to your other post. It just might not be your vibe. But I’m going to be honest, your post history seems a bunch of thoughts on the area. So, you just might not like it around here and that’s fine. 

Also, comparing your undergrad to graduate experience is totally different. That’s like comparing high school to college. They have totally different contexts. Yes, graduate students tend to be working - especially in the evening program. That’s probably why they selected it. They probably have full time jobs, maybe even families. They probably already have a friend group (connected to SCU or not).",10
970,1asxsyu,kqueua8,BaakCoi,"For one thing, UC Davis has over ten times the students. Of course it’ll feel more communal, it’s the size of a small city. Also, you’re not an undergrad anymore. We have classes together and see each other all the time, so there’s plenty of community within the undergrads",6
971,1asxsyu,kqz71k2,Um_yeah_right_,"UCD = 41,000 students vs. 9100 SCU students. The fact that you have some grammatical errors and use the word ""conversate"" (which is a non-standard word that no one uses) implies that maybe English is your second language. Could it be that there are more immigrants at UCD so you were on the same wavelength? UCs admit based solely on grades while SCU is a private school that considers extracurriculars, test scores, the whole student. SCU students tend to have good social skills and are intelligent, not UCB/UCLA level of book smart but they are balanced and employers like to hire SCU students because they have both the social skills and smarts. Having three adult children, I have seen that when the GPA and AP classes are very high, the social skills go down because they are studying too much or they are simply nerds, which is fine too but more of a UCD student population that perhaps you affiliate with more. And when hiring, employers look for likability so grades are not as critical as social skills. 

Social media and technology has killed a lot of face-to-face contact. The Surgeon General even says that loneliness is an epidemic now. It all started due to COVID lockdowns.

Grad students cannot be compared to undergrad students. The stats to be admitted to grad school are lower than undergrad. My son is a grad student at SCU and he has found a lot of friends in classes. Since you are a grad student, you would probably align with grad students more. Did you tour SCU prior so you could feel the vibe? I hope you can find your tribe at SCU, there are others who are struggling with friends too and I wish you well.",3
972,1asxsyu,kqy5maw,Present_Constant1264,"Funny I have a friend from Davis who says the exact opposite. He hates Davis because nobody really interacts and just sort of minds their own business, while SCU is very social. I think your post about clubs is true, mostly because clubs are kind of a small part of campus life. Most people I know just do them for the resume or grad school application. The real social life is either in certain sports, greek life, or in general in the dorms. Im an undergraduate and I think SCU is pretty social compared to other schools, I'd call it a tier 2 party school. Tier 1 being like Alabama or ASU, those big sports/frat schools. SCU has a lot of parties, and I definitely know people who go out every day, but its a lot more chill. Its a smaller school, so everyone kind of knows each other or knows people who knows each other.

Sorry you're having a bad experience. I think in general the grad program here seems pretty lonely from what I have seen. As for academics, I don't know what Accounting 3000 is, but for undergrad we have accounting 11. A lot of people find it hard, I personally didn't. Maybe they're just hungover to class or something lol.",1

I’d say Maybe it might be different in the dorms, Greek life, idk. I haven’t heard of any parties at all at SCU. Never been to one 

Accounting 3000 is the same as accounting 11. Just different course titles.",1
976,1asxsyu,kqwkd8p,malinny,"I didn't feel at all as an undergrad that people like to keep to themselves. As a graduate student, I had my friends and didn't speak much with other graduate students outside of school/surface level things. 

Also think from the perspective of an undergrad...there's a graduate student hanging around... I assume you're 2-5 years older than them? You don't live on campus, you don't have mutual friends etc. Most college friendships are just born out of proximity. I don't think I knew one graduate student as an undergrad. 

At the end of the day, it sucks you're feeling like this. I met most my friends through sports. It might be time to just try joining a local league or exploring hobbies/meet ups outside of SCU if it's not working for you.",2

Just need to decide what’s more important to you the education you’re getting or weather and if size of school or school spirit matter to you.  Maybe write out a list of pros and cons for each and see how they compare on paper.,1
984,1apb46o,kqjk1r2,DistributionStreet58,"Well IU and UT are both huge power 5 schools with a big emphasis on sports and everything that goes with it.

Reputation of the school is a minor factor. How about the costs of each? Where do you currently live? Out of state tuition is high for all 3 schools.  IU and UT are comparable state schools.

However you get what you pay for maybe have a look at the payscale statistics (post graduation salary) they rank Scu up really highly. Whatever you choose all your schools are great and you can be proud of your admissions.",1
986,1apb46o,kqy7gn1,Present_Constant1264,"Tennessee does not have good weather, don't know who told you that lol. Its like a slightly warmer Indiana. Both are within like 200 miles of each other too. Bay Area is pure sunshine from April to October, and only rains in the winter. Tour the school in May and you'll see the whole school outside tanning in the gardens and quads, or at the pool, or going to darties in bikinis. Mediterranian weather as they call it. Also don't pick a school for the weather, pick it for what you actually like. Weather is a nice to have not a must lol. 

IMO Kelley is a fantastic business school. Leavey is also fantastic but the way that recruitment works is it's very biased toward big names. In investment banking, for example they have ""target"" schools (think Ivy leagues) that banks specifically recruit from. Consulting firms also have quotas for different schools, and some (like EY Parthenon, for example) simply don't hire SCU students, they only hire target school students. In that regard, Kelley might be better.

I'd also think about it as a west coast vs east coast thing. Its all about who you know and your personal brand. SCU has great placement in tech. If you're interested in, say corporate finance at Apple, I know a lot of people from SCU there. If you're more interested in the east coast, say Wall Street in NY, then Kelley probably has more connections there. Coming to SCU will give you connections in the west coast and a personal brand as a tech-centered person. East coast has more traditional jobs like industrials or finance, while west coast is all about tech or healthcare. Culture is also better out west. More work-life balance and you can go to work in sweatpants. 

In terms of school spirit, SCU honestly doesn't have a lot. We're not a big sports school and we don't have a football team. Our basketball team is good, and a lot of people go to the games, but it is not the center of campus life like you'd see at a UMich or USC or something. Sororities are pretty chill here also.

There are a couple things holding me back from choosing either school:

SCU: Maybe too small of a school? Campus felt pretty small and not super college bubble vibe? but not neccesarily a bad thing either. Also very expensive and what happens if tech companies move out of silicon valley while I am college. SCU doesn’t have a ton of national recognition and I may be left with a low tier job as many don’t know abt. Also like no school spirit.

IU: The weather isnt the biggest thing but it’s kind of a drag. I am also slightly worried about the sorority rushing as that seems stressful. Also i’ve heard how hard the ICOR classes are but maybe that’s a good thing. Also LOTS of instaters meaning potentially a dif vibe? Also big class sizes meaning it will be hard to be able to connect with professors. Also not a ton to do around campus comapred to scu which could be a pro or con.

992,1apb46o,kz1bzne,Present_Constant1264,"Sorry for the late reply - I'll answer these one-by-one.

SCU is \~6k undergrad so definitely small-mid size. Personally I like that, like it feels like more of a community, people trust each other more. 

Campus is sadly a bubble. I didn't have a car until my 3rd year, so like when I got off campus I either ubered or took the train. That is the case for most colleges though.  

It is expensive, it sucks. Tech companies definitely won't leave the bay area anytime soon. People have been saying that for like 30 years. It is a positive feedback loop of talented engineers come to silicone valley for work and companies come to silicon valley to find engineers. Every single tech company, even European and Asian ones, have a silicon valley office for that reason. Talent.

Yeah it doesn't have much national recognition. I mean I have some friends going to New York post-grad. It has good regional recognition, where in the west coast everyone knows SCU. I think that is a good thing if you wanna stay in the west coast.

Yes, also very little school spirit except for occasional soccer/basketball games.

Every school has its pros and cons. Personally idc about school spirit, like I never really liked sports anyways. I also like California so I definitely wanna stay here post-grad. In that case, the cons are ones I can live with.",1

Plus, you don't have to take as many humanity classes as an engineer like religion, civic engagements, writing, etc.

If you do decide to switch to CS from CSE though, I believe the process is not too difficult as CS is less competitive than CSE.

2. People are pretty nice. I'd say about half of people join greek life, but if that's not your thing like me, you really have to join clubs to meet people. Clubs, on campus job, just anything outside of classes.
3. Classes completely vary. Small class sizes like high school, teachers are generally good and helpful.
4. For dorms, first there is Swig. Recommended if you like partying and don't care about sleeping. Dunne is like a milder swig, same with McWalsh. San Fillippo and Campisi don't have the greatest facilities, but both are good mediums balancing social life and the abilioty to have a nice room to yourself and actually be able to sleep. Then there's graham and finn, the most competitive of dorms. Super nice amenities, but good luck trying to get into those as everyone and their mother wants in. Lastly, there is Casa Italiana and Sobrato, not too much of a social life, but nice amenities and facilities, and Sobrato has a lot of singles.
5. Party life is pretty active. It's a lot harder to get into parties if you aren't in greek life, but there are still some open ones every so often. 

I'm still a freshman. Getting used to it all. I haven't loved my experience a ton so far, but that probably is because I have a harder time making friends. I've joined clubs and met some nice people there, but still haven't quite found my people. The academics are very tough IMO, but  I'm not the smartest kid at the school. (Feels like everyone is smarter than me.) 

Good luck. hopefully you'll have better luck and like it more than me",6
1078,197tnjr,ki5hw5u,letusc4968,"1) it’s not anything super crazy or exclusive so if your interested it could be something to add to your resume. You get priority class registrations which is a bonus.

2) I definitely recommend joint a club within your major or interests and then if you play any sports the club sports are a phenomenal way to make friends and build a community. I’m in both and I can strongly say that’s how I made most of my friends. Be friendly in your dorm aswell that can help.

3) classes are smaller which makes it so much easier to connect with your professor and you get to know people in you major quickly once you get to upper divs 

4) really it’s only swig and dunne that aren’t the best. Swig has the reputation but dunne is on the corner of the street and is extremely loud on Friday nights. I lived in mcwalsh both my freshman and sophomore and I didn’t party really and I really enjoyed it.

5) parties are easy to get in if your a girl, sometimes they’ll be at “max capacity” and then they don’t let anyone in. The first week and some holidays they let guys in. The darties (sat frat parties) I don’t think are too good. But on Halloween the parties are exciting and it’s really just what you make of it.

The experience at SCU is what you make it! People are friendly here and there’s communities for everyone. So definitely go out of your way to participate. Follow all the club and university instagrams bc there are SO MANY events like guest speakers, performances shows, drag shows and so much more. Put yourself out there and you will make friends :)",3
1079,197tnjr,ki306e6,themusician11,"1. It's not completely set aside. They don't have their own set of dorms but they live in certain dorms, and yes they do take regular electives with people outside the honors program.
2. People are pretty nice, and I've mostly made friends through my classes. As for other ways, either clubs or greek life.
3. Classes are pretty normal sized. They can range from 15-35 depending on which class it is. Collaboration and a hands on experience depends on what course you are taking.
4. I commute so can't really say anything about this!
5. I'm not really sure about this.

It will probably take a while to adjust, but hopefully you'll be able to settle in as soon as possible and get used to every aspect of it. Let me know if you have any more questions!",2

1113,193gz1u,kpe4z97,-lmayonnaise-,"I went thru the honors program and will disagree here for a few practical reasons. First of all, honors program gives u priority registration.

The rest of the classes you can take as honors religion. If you are diligent about keeping an eye out for the right classes, you won’t have any additional classes besides honors 20 (an easy seminar class).

Additionally, the honors thesis requirement is actually a really great tool. I can’t tell you how many times I’ve been asked about my thesis project in job/internship interviews. It’s a great bragging point that sets your resume apart.

Therefore, there is no room in those dorms for others. For instance, my son was in Swig for the social in freshman year and for sophomore year he couldn't get into Finn, Graham, or any other dorm but Dunne because most people stayed in their dorms for the next year so nothing was available despite him having a decent housing selection time. As far as Swig, his only complaint was that the room was too small, it wasn't super loud, he even studied in his room, although it was still social. It all depends who is on your floor. At Dunne, he says he dislikes the students more, so it's just luck of the draw. Dunne is only 5 floors while Swig is 11 floors so the elevators are faster at Dunne and there is air conditioning at Dunne and it has communal bathrooms so it's still social. 

He joined a frat in freshman year. If you think you might go Greek or somehow have friend connections and don't need to meet them in the dorm, it could be better to choose Finn, Graham, or other so you can get the same room the next year. Although big/newer, those are very anti-social, you can hear a pin drop. 

Whatever you do, put yourself out there and be friendly wherever you are in the first week.

The smarter plan is to plan a diet to accommodate their needs. At minimum, they need access to a plan. From there, it's seeing what works best like eating more carbs, more veggies, etc. Honestly, you save more when you live outside of campus and you can drive to stores like Big Lots or Costco",3

First of all, I think your odds are excellent. SCU looks for veterans, and your gpa of course really helps. While CS is hard to get into, I think your service and experience makes you stand out.

Regarding age range, naturally for any university, the vast majority of undergraduate students come right out of high school, so most ppl come in at 18/19 and graduate by 21/22. That being said, I have a few friends who are also veterans and are in their mid twenties at SCU undergrad.

Clubs usually meet at night, and classes are late morning-early afternoon. 

I used Voc Rehab and didn't have to pay anything towards tuition. Got an internship this past summer and return offer. I don't think SCU had really much to do with that. 

If you're looking to make friends, SCU might be a bit small? Plus there are quite a few students who commute. SJSU also has a bunch of commuters, but also a lot more students. 

If you're looking to get a degree, SCU was insanely easy for me. Graduated with a 3.1, but barely studied at all. I probably spent less than 10 hours each week studying/doing homework while enrolled in 3-4 classes.",1

1217,18o9qz9,keyhwe3,-lmayonnaise-,"Hi, I’m a former employee at the busn school and have sat in on many admissions sessions and have seen the admissions scoring rubric, so I hope I can provide some insight.

Unfortunately the others commenting are right, you don’t have the best odds. The average gpa for compsci and engineering at SCU are above 3.8 these days, it’s getting really competitive. My brother applied EA for psych at SCU with a 3.8  test optional and got waitlisted. I got in to busn school with a 3.9 and 33 act. 


Admissions is very hollistic, and they care about well rounded applicants A LOT. So not having very many extra curriculars is going to hurt you more than the gpa. SCU will admit people with lower than average gpa if and only if they have a well rounded app and ECs, as well as an explanation for why the gpa is low (an example that admissions have shown me is a student that had to work part time in hs to support his family).  If your essays are really truly excellent, they can potentially fill that gap that admissions is missing with your GPA and lack of ECs.

Bellermine I thought was officially affiliated with SCU historically, so it makes a lot of sense.  One thing I noticed about Ca is that there aren't many white hispanics, which is pretty wierd given that Ca historically was a part of New Spain.  But I guess because of Stanford and Big Tech and probably also the Mexican American war, the vast majority of whites in the bsy area are non-hispanic and jewish.  And then, you have SCU which is packed with white hispanics, itallians and other latin people.  It's ironic.  

Really catholicism is a minority in the US, and so are hispanic whites.  Myself going through the catholic school system I grew up around all hispanic people.  Anyway, just something I noticed and always thought was an odd thing about SCU, Ca history and the way it is now post mexican american war.  

Didn't realize loyola academy was a big feeder.  Isn't there a Loyola catholic college in Chicago already?

I'm a big fan of the catholic education system for everything except math.  I prefer a structuralist or fictionalist philosophy of math over a platonist one.

MBA Students

What you're experiencing regarding student interactions, is not you imagining things. Many of your fellow MBA students are in the same boat. 

1) They're enrolled in a high-priced program that advertises a 2-year track. So they feel pressured to follow this model without admitting to anyone outside (let alone their selves) that they are under extreme pressure to complete it on time. This leads to false interactions you may perceive that they ""have it all together""

\-I purposefully took 3 years to complete my MBA. Paying an already high-priced tuition without taking advantage of the campus, networking and events was not my plan. I saw several MBA students burn out after just 3 quarters and ""take a break"" where I think some dropped out. I don't regret one bit of my plan, in fact, I encourage anybody to enjoy the ride.

&#x200B;

Santa Clara City 

2) Santa Clara City and the University are inherently separate. San Jose, Sunnyvale, and the surrounding South Bay all have their planning challenges, and traffic, commuting, etc. all are things outside of SCU. Every educational institution has its infrastructure challenges. 

\-I was recently at a CSU interview for a role and learned about the politics and challenges of their school . . yikes. Also, what are tuition reimbursement terms? Yikes, I'm in for my post-SCU challenges. \*\*\*Personal rant

Thank you for the comments, and kind advice. Do you think that this is just the nature of the part time evening MBA program. I work, but not full time (or at least not 40 hours per week). I definitely want to take advantage of all the campus activities and resources, or at least some of them. Though, I find that many are just a waste of time ( such as some of the career events ie). They give a false impression of some careers, and often times I can't land jobs or roles with those certain careers. Though, there is a nice networking aspect to them and you can defentely learn through other people in them. I wish there was more socializing in the program. To learn more about how students landed up in thier career paths they are in, learn how post grad life is for them and how they are copping with it. It's definitely important. But it seems like people just want to do the bare minimum and just get the paper, and leave. It's the students that make this program a disappointment. I had hopped to advance my career in this program, find roles that I could not get out of undergrad. Maybe my expectations were unrealistic, but so far, I just have not seen this out of the program, and am just disappointed. I literally also hoped I could find my lifelong partner through this program. Which is 99% not going to happen.",1

1289,186ekiv,kbi9a21,themexpride,"MBAs are the 2nd chance to strike gold in someone's career. If it didn't help you, it just didn't. The program is delivering results as a lot of executives in the Bay Area have ties to the SCU MBA program. If you are expecting a similar experience to undergrad, this program (and other MBAs) isn't the right fit.

In terms of ROI, it's able to hold up. If you aren't getting that from this program, I would analyze your plan as networking, (forced) socialization, and connecting with your professors is the key to achieving this. As much as you may hate the experience, it's more about the connections you make that determines the ROI.

As for Santa Clara itself, you'll get mixed opinions. Not as shit as SF. Expensive sure, but safer than SJ. Yeah, you meet lots of fake individuals at some points. Some are just putting a mask and it's up to you to get them to open up. As for the rest, let them be - you can't change them.

1291,186ekiv,khxidgd,coast-to-desert,"Of course! Always happy to help in any way I can. . 

I do think that because you are encountering students who ""want the paper"" and the ""MBA"" behind their names, there is a direct correlation between time spent in groups or commitment to follow through on group assignments. Unfortunately, in any MBA program, you will find these folks and, even worse, ""type A""  personalities who project themselves to know more than others. This is the human condition and an over-exertion of their ego. Many call this . . ignorance lol. Please don't let them bother you at all. You're on your life track, and if you don't value these shallow, worldly things, pay them no mind. It will bug them that you don't give them validation. An MBA will not give even the smartest person an automatic job post-graduation. It's the soft skills that take a person to success. An MBA is just a polishing effect on a resume to help and the hard skills to prove what you've learned and know.  Don't let the environment get to you. During my time in the program, I was a complete outcast from an industry that was nowhere near close to my classmates. I used to arrive at the parking lot with a muddy truck and sometimes muddy boots from the fields. I didn't care; they weren't paying my tuition. lol. 

&#x200B;

As far as becoming a part of the school, there might be more than meets the eye. I wasn't an undergrad at SCU, so I spent plenty of time becoming a part of the campus as a grad student. I went to the gym late at night, went to the swimming pool and library for hours, and music events. Not to mention theatre performances. Oh, someone did mention in another reply The Hut! (I got my t-shirt there, too). My favorite was the occasional noon mass (not bringing religion, but still a valid point). So keep the MBA student title from creating parameters of what you can and can't do on campus. Yes, Leavey had some networking events; some were great, and maybe some were lame. But that's a give-and-take, just like real life. You're paying tuition for a complete experience, so use it. I did for 3 years and loved the campus as a place away from my workplace to decompress. 

&#x200B;

I agree with you fully; they don't give you the real deal of post-grad life. My post-grad has been challenging in complete honesty. I graduated and was left to become self-employed as my own industry has been facing its own economic and self-inflicted managerial challenges. All while tuition payments have been coming in (yikes!). But that is real life. My other fellow cohorts in tech and finance have also been struggling as the economy is struggling in Silicon Valley and abroad. VC funding shrinking, hiring freezes, layoffs, and stifled innovation. So if anyone says the grass is greener after the MBA, the reality is a continuation of life as was before the MBA program. . with more bills! 

I sure hope that I can one day laugh about this period of my life with my ""future"" wife and kids! I must mention that I did not meet during the MBA program, hahaha! 

Anyway, take some of the advice with a grain of salt. Look me up on my profile to find my LinkedIn. I would name-drop some excellent people to connect with, but I'd like to respect their privacy here on Reddit.

1305,1802uzx,ka4i6wy,k615perry,"Food: overall alright in the dining hall and new engineering building 

Study abroad: super popular, easy to do just plan out your courses well

Clubs: clubs are pretty active and are a great way to meet people. Join as much as you can especially freshman year

School spirit: just alright. Not much excitement for school spirit other than men’s basketball and women’s soccer

Safety: overall pretty safe, area surrounding can be a little sketchy but nothing happens on campus

Professors: not your major but majority are helpful and are really accessible after class

Diversity: definitely got better over the years, could be even better but can’t complain about how much it’s grown

Prestige: mainly competitive for business school, engineering, and CS. Not sure on public health

Location: barely any food surrounding immediate campus, definitely need a car to get to fun places 

People: honestly some are super great and others are just stuck up and will not talk to you, but the fun people are great though!",5
1306,1802uzx,ka7g65l,5torm,"Food: Pretty decent. I would say that it’s not nearly as bad as some people make it out to be.

Study Abroad: Lots of people do it each year. I wanted to go to Spain through SCU, but wasn’t selected. I ended up just finding a third party study abroad provider (API) and went to Spain through them instead.

Clubs: Good selection for most people, but harder if you have more niche interests (I wanted to do MUN and eSports-adjacent activities, but there weren’t clubs for either of those things).


School Spirit: Fairly average. If you go to sports events frequently, there are many students that also go regularly.

Safety: Never felt unsafe on campus, personally. Just avoid putting yourself in a compromised position at off-campus parties and that’s about all there is to it.

Professors: The best part about SCU, in my opinion. I also minored in Spanish and I loved all my classes and instructors.

Diversity: Slightly more diverse than the United States at large. About half-caucasian and half-everything else.

Prestige: One of the best schools in the West, and top 50 in the country.

Location: Terrible. Unless you own a car or have close friends that own a car, you will quite literally never leave campus with any kind of regularity. There is virtually nothing to do within Santa Clara itself, or even San Jose for that matter. It’s about 2 hours each way to San Francisco by train.

People: Overall fine, but the tricky part is finding YOUR people. Not every kind of person is represented at SCU, depending on what metrics you use.",2

Greek life by design will show you only a very narrow range of people. Greek life also tends to be very white and upper class because it’s expensive, so if you think that’s your crowd then go for it, but you won’t get exposed to a lot of different types of people in Greek life as compared to student orgs maybe for your major or social orgs of things you’re interested in.",1

I won’t sugarcoat anything though. My biggest negetives were as follows: 

the school is predominantly white, which was a bit of a culture shock for me growing up in the San Fernando valley, and consists of a lot of wealthy students. The school does a half decent job at attempting to widen diversity and inclusion, and after I got acclimated I never felt singled out by the school.  But as a whole everyone that I interacted with was super nice, both student and faculty alike. 

Although I was never a part of it there were always negative stories about the frats near campus. There were some sexual assault issues, especially in 2022. I think it might seem like there are a lot of parties at the school, and there is - but it’s no ASU. 

And even then, those negatives didn’t affect me much on a personal level. I got very lucky with my roommates and am now lifelong friends with them. I never felt any extra pressure to go party either, I generally stayed away from the frats. To me at least, the school was pretty much as advertised - which may not be what you were looking for or expecting, but it’s true (for me at least). 

My dream school when I was applying was Cal, and in hindsight I’m extremely blessed to have gone to SCU instead. Feel free to ask any more questions, I’m happy to answer",25

Psych is a large major at SCU, especially because a lot of people double major in Psych and something else. The size is very comfortable IMO-you meet new people every day but you’ll also see friends regularly and make friends in your major. 

There are parties, but a majority of students party rarely if at all. The party culture at scu is as much or as little as you want. This is nothing like UCSB in terms of party schools. 

The campus probably felt a bit weird because it’s thanksgiving break and a huge number of students went home. It’s a lot more lively most of the time.",3

SCU is beautiful because they work so hard to keep it that way. The Mission and garden are lovely. The picturesque campus looks like it belongs in a movie. 

During freshman welcome, President Sullivan gave a wonderful speech about how college should not be a huge competition where you look to your right and left and one of you will be gone in a year; but rather look to your left and right and in the future, those people will be your best friends, people in your wedding, and people you will travel with - and that college was a journey to find out more about yourself. 

Our interaction with faculty and staff has been great - they are extremely responsive and helpful. Professors are available and approachable during office hours and have held Zoom review sections the evening before or on a Saturday before a mid-term to help students. Classes are challenging but doable and you get the sense that professors are there to help you succeed, not to trick you.

My child (not a partier) went to a frat party the first weekend and didn't think much of it - hasn't been to another one and has made good friends to socialize and study with. Some students, who live not too far away, do go home for the weekend. Overall, we're very pleased with SCU and are proud to be a Bronco!",2

For us, it has been expensive, but worth it.

But no two kids, and no two experiences are the same. If your child is confident, curious and self-motivated then some of the advantages we see may not be as valuable to her, or the difference in cost might be able to be applied to other aspects of her life that are more impactful.",1

If you transfer to SCU and fail at CS, is there any other major that would work for you? I'm unsure that SCU accepts community college transfers.

First of all bel is a catholic private highschool and scu is a private catholic college and the two schools used to be conjoined before they eventually split off into the two respective schools they are now. so of course it’s going to be easy to get into scu as a bell since belle did the selection process already and found the people that they thought fit their ethos best, and what fits bellarmine will fit Santa Clara.

Arts & Sciences GPAs at SCU are 3.56 - 3.88 as listed on the website so your grades are at the low end. The only reason it's as high as 3.88 is due to the Computer Science majors. Colleges don't care about weighted GPAs besides UCs. 

There are a lot of considerations in admissions and some of them have nothing to do with your application. They want a sprinkle of this, a sprinkle of that, maybe they are looking for more minorities, etc., there is no one-size-fits-all guaranteed application. Harvard claims they could have 3 classes of freshmen because the applications are so strong but they only have enough space for 1 freshman class. 

If you really want to be admitted as stated in the last sentence, you should apply ED because they are more lenient since they know the student has promised to attend SCU if admitted so it helps their numbers. But I am unsure if it affects scholarships, ie you might not get a scholarship because they know they've got you—something worthwhile to ask SCU. SCU also doesn't offer a lot of scholarships except to Catholics, D1 athletes, and underrepresented minorities. Why roll the dice and regret not applying ED? 

You likely won't get an offer from EA, the Ivy League applications, athletes and Catholics get those spots, unless they really want Poly Sci majors.

That said, he would be better off at UC Berkeley, but there are other issues with being at UCB such as lack of dorms and Oakland next door, leading to crime on campus. Other UCs could be a consideration too; since they are so large, there will be a larger of students. I don't think of SCU as being an artsy person's college. Nor would Chapman be good, if that's a consideration. Someone mentioned going to an LGBTQ club. SCU surprisingly has no student orientation like other private schools do! My other son had week-long activities so students could meet each other. Therefore, all SCU students need to hit the ground running in search of friends. Some don't and end up lonely. Then after everyone finds friends, it's even more difficult. It's not like when I attended college in the 80's where everyone's door was open because we HAD to do that to meet people, there were no mobile phones (most colleges these days have closed doors at dorms because people have lower social skills due to technology). No, frats are not for everyone, there is a lot of drinking and there are only maybe 6 frats and it takes a certain personality to join a frat, usually the ""cool"" kids or talkative ones. I wouldn't recommend it for most people and especially to a gay person. Frats have open parties the first few weeks but then they are closed to males. There are open parties again during the year but maybe only once a month. I have heard that life at SCU revolves around the Greeks but don't understand it because there aren't that many frats and sororities. Each frat has maybe only 30-75 brothers.",1

As for social life, it's not Greek Life dependent. It's emphasized by kids who are fully devoted to it from the start. It's annoying to clarify Greek life as there's also professional co-ed fraternities and other unknown types of groups. But to be honest, it's only a small subset of the university social life. There's people who simply don't bother with it or plain-out avoid it. Also take into account the commuters, the grad and law students, and the ones who study too much don't have time for it. 

At some point, it will be necessary to have a car to go out of the university bubble and socialize with people you like. SF and other Bay Area spots are just a drive away. It's a refreshing break to be able to drive away for the weekend.

Overall, Greek life is only relevant cause students find most of them host parties consistently. However, there's also non-Greek life parties and alternatives out there.",3

CS in Arts & Sciences at SCU is challenging and a lot of students drop out after the first quarter or first year. The second year is even more challenging, especially depending on the instructors. CS in general is a difficult subject to teach so most students have to figure it out on their own or through tutors and cannot rely on the instructors to hand-hold and teach them how to code. CS at SCU is a BS which requires many math classes with engineering students (not all schools require CS students to be with engineering students). You must be very, very good at math, like at least AB lane math, not merely regular lane math in high school even if you got As in regular lane. In addition, there is a bogus STEM rule that 50% of the class must receive a C grade. If you are accepted to SCU, no harm in trying a CS class, you will know within the first year if succeeding is possible.",1

1422,16ktx46,k4e7l2l,Real-male-,"SCU housing policies are bogus. Years ago Swig Hall was for freshmen only. The fact that freshmen can get into Finn or the nicer dorms allows them to stay in their same room the next year. Therefore, anyone who is in Swig will never get into any of the nicer dorms because they will be taken by the sophomores who grab their same rooms from freshman year. I had a good housing selection time (first day, early afternoon) but everything good was gone by the time I was able to access the rooms so in my second year I was in Dunne. If you are in Swig on the street side and the heat is too brutal, you can get one of those air conditioners with the hose such as this: [https://www.bestbuy.com/site/whynter-400-sq-ft-portable-air-conditioner-and-heater-frost-white/1269061.p?skuId=1269061](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/whynter-400-sq-ft-portable-air-conditioner-and-heater-frost-white/1269061.p?skuId=1269061) All the while Housing told me that ACs are perfectly okay, our RA charged me $50 during the Winter Break room check. However, I didn't contact Housing for a refund and was able to keep it the entire year. It's mainly the first few months of the year and the last couple that are hot. I thought the social life would be great at Swig but it all depends on the students. I didn't care for most of them, they were meatheads. Finn, Graham, and other dorms are extremely quiet so meeting people is more difficult. What I disliked the most was that the Swig room was very small and there is nowhere to hang your stuff while showering except in the shower with you. Dunne was much better because there was a separate place for hanging clothes outside the shower and there is air conditioning.",4

That being said, I think an important part of college is learning to share space with someone; sometimes they're your best friend but other times you just cohabitate. It's good to practice conflict resolution etc., and the CFs are there to help navigate any enforcement issues around the shared rules you and your roomie form. On the whole, though, most people are pretty decent. My first year roomie was pleasant enough but we never hung out and very rarely spoke outside logistical stuff like letting them know I'd be back late that night or something. It was just fine, and sophomore year I roomed with my best friend who is still my best friend to this day.

Either way both roads will lead to a strong career path for you with both schools having great outcomes when it comes to the fields of engineering.

Does class size matter to you? Do you like to go to parties? I think you should go to UC Davis if Aerospace Engineering is your passion due to the Bachelors, but there are plenty more factors to consider.",1
1599,13sevqs,jma5drn,hpunlimited,"I attended both schools but not for that degree. I can mention some factors however. Are you local to the Bay Area, if yes do you plan to commute to SCU or live on/near campus? Santa Clara is not far from all major Bay Area cities if you want that access. SCU is a private university with Jesuit values if that matters to you. Smaller campus and student body, facilities are top of the line in technology -- being in the heart of Silicon Valley. No shortage of internship opportunities there

If you go to UCD, your option is to move away from home and enjoy the freedom. With that said, Davis is a college town with a lot of local residents as well. You’ll find more things to do the more sociable you are, as the next major city is Sacramento, but you won't need to venture out there much. UCD is a public university with a big focus on sustainability, large campus and student body. In my experience the majority of students were from out of the area, a lot of diversity, and bonds form from it

If you want to play the long game, you can still experience both campuses. SCU has a graduate program for your major, something to consider if you plan to live/work in the Bay Area after undergraduate.  I did undergrad at UCD and master's at SCU so that was my experience.",1

The vast majority of upper division classes that CS students take are from the CSE department anyways. Mind you that you can of course still opt for CS and take CSE classes to get the knowledge you’re specifically targeting with a lighter course load, but keep in mind that CSE student registrations will inherently take priority over you when signing up for such classes as a CS student: and given that CSE is perpetually impacted (every freshman slot available for the major gets filled without fail every year), it means that you may not end up being able to get into those data science classes that you had initially swapped majors for in the first place.",1

1706,12kh04k,jg66oof,Hirorai,"Graduated from SCU a decade ago, but during my time there I took the VTA every day. In terms of safety, it was fine. There are some odd (but not dangerous) folk who ride the VTA, but nothing that would threaten your son's safety. 

The only incident I had in 4 years was when I boarded an almost empty bus after class to go to work and there was a guy around my age sitting in the back seat. I sat next to him and rested my head on bus wall and closed my eyes to rest. He understandably got mad and cussed me out, saying that there are dozens on empty seats and I had to sit next to him. It's because on VTA buses the back seat is the only place you can rest your head against the side of the bus without banging your forehead against the window frame whenever the bus comes to a stop. I didn't feel like explaining that to him, so I just ignored him. He continued to cuss me out until the bus got to his stop, where he challenged me to step out and fight him.

In my experience, the surrounding area is safe as well. I remember when I played intramurals in the evening, the buses would be done for the day by the time my games finished. So I had the option of either walking home or calling my dad to pick me up. My dad is a busy man, so I just kept walking home (roughly 90 minutes) until one day I let slip that I was walking home after intramurals. My dad made me promise him that I would call him to pick me up from that point onward. It didn't really feel dangerous walking home; sometimes I'd walk past groups of teenagers in dark areas but I never got mugged or anything. I remember I would be playing my Nintendo 3DS as I walked home and I never got robbed.  

The VTA is not reliable. Sometimes, the bus just wouldn't come. Not just not arrive on time, but not arrive at all.",3

Security guards at bus stops? Hahahaha. House him on campus or within walking distance to campus even if you have to get a second job to pay for it. Sure, he could be fine but I wouldn’t risk it with the lunacy and lawlessness that prevails these days.

So it must be possible if a few classes cover majors and minors right? My kid may want to double minor at SCU too but unfortunately her interests are kind of all over the place. I don’t think for her it would be wise if she wants to have some social life. 

What will be your major and the possible minors?",1
1712,12kf5xm,jg6wvrv,missionbmw,"Yes, a double minor is a thing. The feasibility mostly depends on the credits required for your major, your academic work load, and the requirements for the minor.",1
1713,12jbtdh,jfxknqa,pizza496,"I’m working based on the assumption that your child is finishing high school this year. 

If they declared a major as a part of the admissions process, they should talk to their advisor about switching. Both classics and neuroscience are in the college of arts and sciences so no worries there. If they haven’t declared yet, they have until the end of second year to declare (I’m fairly certain, but I’m in the engineering school so some things might be different).

https://www.scu.edu/cas/neuroscience/academic-program/

This is the link to the neuroscience major’s general information, I would advise clicking on the the “Advising for first years” button, because that gives suggested class schedules for first year students.

ETA: regardless, your student should talk with their advisor because knowing things like this is a part of their job.",3
1714,12jbtdh,jfxkx77,OkDragonfruit5441,"Yeah so if your daughter is in classics that would be within the College of Arts and sciences, she would be able to switch to neuro no problem. But if she wanted to switch to bioengineering that’s is within the engineering school and would require a whole internal transfer process. I cannot speak to it as much but I know of the other process because I switched form psych to business.",2
1715,12jbtdh,jfxqa7d,Human_Comfort_4144,Admitted students event is this Saturday. Should we ask about switching majors or is this event more for other areas and not for these sorts of questions?,1

Another major is bioengineering maybe the BS/MS track. That is in the different department. 

Would that be a difficult switch from letters and sciences to engineering?",1
1717,12jbtdh,jfxlu3u,Human_Comfort_4144,"Is the advisor assigned upon enrolling by the end of this month? Or assigned when school starts? And are classes assigned to the students in the summer based on their intended major? Just trying to remember my freshman year so many decades ago, and I think they were assigned without us choosing based on our declared major (usfca). But if a student is undeclared, who chooses the classes or what classes should be taken if the major is not known?",1
1718,12jbtdh,jfxm32n,Human_Comfort_4144,So that switch was also from one college to another. How did that process go? Did you start to take business classes and maintain a certain gpa in order to switch? I think my confusion is with the UC system (to switch you need to take prerequisites and get a certain gpa). Is that how SCU works? If switching to bioengineering she needs to take prerequisites first?,1
1719,12jbtdh,jfyrxry,missionbmw,"First year advising was different for me two years ago (2025). Students who choose to attend will be given an appointment time over the summer and will work with faculty in their major to determine a schedule for the first quarter. If they are undeclared, then a drahman advisor will assist in this process. While it may not be ideal, students are usually suggested to take most of their core requirements. If your student does not have a neuroscience advisor, then make sure that they know of the requirements for neuroscience the first quarter to not be behind (ie. Chemistry 11).

Drahman Center will likely have a table at the preview day if you can attend and that’s like be happy to answer any questions that you have. Neuroscience dept may also have a table to ask. I think preview day is a chance to make sure that SCU meets the students goals, and they would be happy to answer your questions.

EDIT: SCU Neuro dept has posted a recommended [first year schedule](https://www.scu.edu/cas/neuroscience/academic-program/advising-for-first-years/). The registrar also has the requirements to switch the major [here](https://www.scu.edu/registrar/frequently-asked-questions/#Change%20Undergraduate%20Major)",2
1720,12jbtdh,jfxpn0k,pizza496,"Looking back through my emails from when I enrolled, course selection occurs during orientation. This means your student will get help with searching for classes and selecting them. Depending on whether they’re still doing this, the person helping might be a peer advisor (older student who is at least in the same general school). Regardless of who is running this part of their orientation, they’ll be able to help with course selection. This is also when your student’s advisor is determined (I think). It might be earlier. 

The good news is that your child selects their own courses, and they’ll have an opportunity to get more direct help then. Even if their orientation is more focused around classics, there will most likely be an opportunity to talk with someone at the Drahmann Center (academic and learning resources center on campus).",2
1721,12jbtdh,jfxnovb,OkDragonfruit5441,"The process was pretty stressful for me cause I had a difficult transition to college courses. I somewhat gambled but set myself up well by talking to the right advisors and making myself known to faculty. I started to take business pre reqs that were outside of the business school that fulfilled business requirements. For business you had to maintain a GPA of above a 3.6 and write a few essays. I got the essays earlier and had someone on the transfer board look at them before they were turned in. 

You do not need to take pre reqs before you transfer but you could be behind if you don’t. Ik that for business that if you transfer during freshman year to start as a business student sophomore year, since it takes places in April you get an answer in may, you would not be behind.",1

The students at this school are very balanced though, they look happy and welcoming. Try to meet whoever ASAP—join clubs or whatever because these days since social media, it's been more difficult to meet others. Back in my day, everyone stood in the dorm hallways with doors open and alcohol parties, it was the only way to meet others, couldn't bury your head into the computer or mobile phone. These days, doors are closed at the majority of colleges and there is a clampdown on alcohol. Even at huge campuses, one can be lonely because students aren't as sociable since tech replaced face-to-face socializing. My son knew he would have to join a frat for a consistent social life so he did. But there are only 6 frats and IDK how many sororities and Greek life isn't for everyone, and the pledging period can be rough. I do know that there are students struggling to find friends, hope you won't be one of them. Frats do have some open parties where males and females can attend, be on the lookout. Bottom line is in all colleges these days (I have other college graduates too), you have to reach out to others and they will be grateful for it because people are more shy these days—don't wait for people to come to you.

I never once felt compelled to party, and never felt pressured to go to any parties and i avoided that whole side of campus incredibly easily. If students want to join a fraternity or sorority (again, it’s not most of campus culture, it’s just a loud minority) that’s a different story. Students in Greek life are expected to participate in party life, which is why I avoided joining one. So the experience and risk for falling into this culture you’re worried about is really about wether you choose to surround yourself with Greek life or not. There are literally DOZENS of clubs and other organizations on campus that provide equivalent, if not, even tighter community than Greek life and that’s what i chose. I would say if students are intentional with who they surround themselves with, they will find their way and easily avoid trouble.

CS is really big here though, and she’d have the resources to succeed, it might just take a little longer haha. i’d also recommend reaching out to a counselor. if you guys do end up choosing SCU, the Drahman center would also be the place to go for advising, in my experience they’ve been very helpful and honest.

1827,11t5d3c,jchw7d9,thecityofthefuture,"Almost all engineering programs are front loaded and very hard in the first 3 semesters. I'd say after year one 70+% of engineering students are below a 3.5. By the time you are a junior and senior getting a 3.5 should be pretty easy. You'll need to manage your GPA and potentially drop classes early if you will get below a B. That is a lot of pressure.

My daughter has a similar GPA requirement and when I brought up the front loaded nature of engineering school they said they wouldn't waive the requirement, but that they would work with you if you are close and making progress. SCU has a high retention rate that they are very proud of and they don't want to see students leave.",6
1828,11t5d3c,jcie1g6,makayeo,"What's up, homie. I did the full IB in high school, HL Art and Physics, majored in Mechanical Engineering, and minored in Studio Art about 5 years ago, and also had a tuitional scholarship that made it possible for me to attend SCU I had to keep a 3.0 for. So, not exactly the same but similar enough. 

I can't speak to the civil department, but to engineering in general. First year classes are generally not weed-out style, that was winter quarter sophomore year. They don't want people dropping out right away. I'd argue the rigor gradually ramps up, but ask people in the civil engineering groups/SCU facebook incoming class of whatever (if they're still doing that) to get the real lowdown. 

Possibly contrary to what you've heard, but I would NOT skip Calc 1, even if you can, especially if it's been awhile since you've done math. For me, it was the first ""oh snap this is what a college level math course feels like"". IB is two years long, you have so, SO much time to study and be ingrained in the material. A college quarter zips by, and if you jump into calc II it might (read, might) be a ruder-than-expected awakening. 

As for art... at the end of the day it's a deeply personal decision. Art and engineering are both problem solving disciplines, they just have different canvases. I was torn between pursuing Studio Art or Mechanical Engineering, and it boiled down to maximizing feasibility. For the first two years of college, I convinced myself that art was something ""I can always do on the side"". Yeah, no. If art is part of who you are, then you can't neglect it at the time you're exploring the adult you'd like to turn into for the rest of your life. I mean you can try, but you might go crazy. 

Look, engineering is always going to make you more money. get you a job, a livelihood easier, all that jazz. It is what it is. Unless you want to pursue being a full-time artist after college and ignore engineering, a major in studio art might not be the answer. However, a minor will give you a firm foothold in the ""art world"" at SCU. You'll have creative assignments you'll love that will mollify the intensely rigorous computations and design tasks they'll give you in the engineering school. You'll meet the art professors who are the most amazing people, you'll meet people who share your ""art brain"" and feed that side of you. A side of you that will probably starve if you're just in the engineering school. And, given time, you'll have the option to more gracefully increase the amount of ""art work"" in your college portfolio. 

Today,  I'm product design engineer where I use every engineering and art tool I learned along the way. And I get a lot of traditional art done on the side, and am constantly grateful I didn't leave those skills behind for engineering alone. 

Sorry for the wall of text, but this is a question I've spent years of my life on. I hope my experience helps you with deciding yours.",3
1829,11t5d3c,jcj88ye,Kevel714,"First of all, congrats! Currently a senior majoring in civil engineering. In terms of difficulty, as long as you put in the work, you're going to be fine. By no means is it a walk in the park, the structural classes are the classes that I find to be the most difficult as it is very math intensive and the professor that teaches it is very rigorous. Additionally, I believe civil engineering has the greatest number of units to complete to fulfill the major meaning you'll be taking more classes (or putting in more hours. typically, a class that has more units means you'll be spending more time doing work for that class).

Calc II covers single variable integrals. If you remember and know how to do derivatives comfortably then I would say you'd be fine in Calc II.

Below is what a typical 4 year-plan would look like.

A little background about myself, I attended Northeastern University in Boston for the first two years of college straight out of high school. I joined the Army ROTC program to compete for the ROTC scholarship, and I did this my freshman year and sophomore year. Long story short, because of COVID, I was unable to receive the scholarship because of the lack of in-person assessment from the ROTC cadre. I made the decision to join the US Army Reserves and possibly get the ROTC scholarship through the Reserves/NG. I deferred from Northeastern and am now studying at De Anza while attending Reservist trainings. I applied for SCU and Stanford as a transfer student for this Fall, and I expressed my experience in ROTC and interest in joining the program if I were to get accepted. I have talked to the ROTC recruiter for both schools and he would gladly form a packet for me to get the scholarship by Fall. 

I am guessing that you do not have Basic Combat Training or Advanced Individual Training under your belt so I am unsure as to how the ROTC recruiter will view your situation. I would definitely give it a try. Better to try then not. Worst case scenario, you can also apply for FAFSA at SCU.

I'm not very familiar with how the process worked for folks transferring from outside SCU into SCU, but from what I remember, students already at SCU had to go through a transfer process to change majors offered by one of SCU's schools to another SCU school. In other words, if a student at SCU wanted to change their major from CS to CSE, they would have to transfer from the School of Arts and Sciences to the School of Engineering. That said, as I understand it, availability of slots for a given transfer can be limited by supply and demand, and it wouldn't surprise me if the demand for CSE spots is very high compared to the supply.

In terms of employability, I would assume that CSE would provide better opportunities, but I am probably biased because I went to the School of Engineering.",1

The classes are not crazy different and I doubt that employers will care much about the differcne as long as you develop the skills needed which you can certainly do in both. The Math and CS degree might allow to you take a slightly lighter load than the typically COEN 17-20 unit load, which might allow you better develop skills outside of the classroom. From a small subset of people I know that are a part of the CS program, I saw that they actually seem to have been more successful in getting internships, but I may be jaded because I know that the people I am thinking about are all high achieving student who would excel in either program.

Both programs offer great elective selections, and you can see for your self by looking at the COEN course offerings as well as the math and computer science course offerings from the scu webpages, and I personally have met and worked with talented and brilliant people in both majors in and outside many of my COEN classes because there is a bit of overlap.",1

Lived in Finn the last two years and it’s definitely quiet but you can also find a super tight-knit group of friends; it’s all about what you make it. Personally, if I could do everything over again, I’d choose swig. Extremely social and while you may lose some sleep, meeting that many people within the first month is essential to how the rest of your college experience goes. 

TLDR: Swig because you’ll meet a fuckton of people.",9
1890,10yz2h6,j86xpos,Here_Fo_Fun,"Swig is good if you like partying, want to be social, but are ok with it being a bit dirty. Finn is lowkey a walk but very nice and not too social. Dunne and mcwalsh are also good social",4
1891,10yz2h6,j815e8r,Puzzleheaded_Map_873,I'd rank camp at three just because that is mostly freshmen and you're more likely to get in there (graham is mostly sophomores). I know ppl in camp and they like it--besides the bathrooms lol.,2
1892,10yz2h6,j81z4gp,Klutzy-Fortune8543,"For what you’re looking for Dunne is a good option. I lived there my freshman year, it was social and the amenities are fine. Overall I would suggest graham tho because it would make it much easier to stay there as a sophomore.",2
1893,10yz2h6,j83brb2,Redeclaw,In Graham this year and I can tell you that it’s nice but also hella quiet,2
1894,10yz2h6,j9dc2t8,Valuable_Ad_5057,Graham is actually pretty good.  The CFs actually hold a lot of events to get everyone out of their rooms and socialize.  There are actually a pretty fair amount of people that show up to those things (including me lol).  The rooms are fairly new and the only issue I've had is my wall deco not sticking to the wall bc the paint is so new.  You should definitely shoot for a newer building! I'm biased obviously but I would put Graham at the top lol,1
1895,10yz2h6,jd6zodx,PrecautiousMoney,"Lived in McWalsh and it’s pretty hit or miss. If social life is THAT important to you just go to Swig for a true college freshman experience. But you can easily make friends and not rely on your residence hall for socializing and opt for a more comfortable option like graham, Finn or sobrato. I would say dunne or mcwalsh aren’t worth it for either socializing or comfort. Hope this helps.",1

1926,10p40i8,j6qjgp5,themexpride,"I've talked to grad students in CS before. Basically, it's rigorous if you haven't been exposed to the classes you're taking. Many of them, coming from India typically, are well versed in those topics and can keep up with the curriculum. 

As for courses, they have a great selection of courses to choose from, which I envy (undergrad CS). One of them took a course in Mobile Development, another in Cloud Computing. It's still useful to have an idea of what you plan to do once you graduate so you choose those courses that prepare you for that career.

Living expenses are kinda expensive since it's the Bay Area. It's basically gonna take you a lot of effort to be frugal. Also, given you're international, you probably need to have a good financial position. It's really up to you to decide if you can take this financial burden.

On campus job opportunities are out there. Best choice is to work as a TA for undergraduate courses. Those jobs pay very well. From here, you have various options to choose from for a minimum-wage job. Many are accommodating with your schedule and it can be a position where you can even do HW.

Job opportunities are limited right now in the area. You probably need to think it over if that's a deal-breaker. Many graduate students need to find everywhere for positions that will sponsor them (H1-B). It's gonna take lots of interview preparation to find that position as well as looking across the US.

Scholarships are very limited. You're guaranteed to take out loans. It's a matter of finding work to offset the loans. I haven't tried applying for the program until I can find a company who will pay for it. That's how I will be able to get a Master's for free (hopefully).

It's a huge investment in the end. I don't think you should take the opportunity if you're not 100% committed to focus on finding a job in the Bay Area. I've seen how committed many of my grad friends have been to find a job. Projects, interview prep, Leetcode. Some even have the SWE experience under the belt, but still need that Master's to remain competitive and get those high-paying positions.

As of now, it's pretty difficult to find local internships. Some of the MS students I met have struggled to find an internship this year. It helps to do well in hackathons and similar events as they may guarantee you a summer internship. Ultimately, it's up to what roles you apply and what you're willing to accept.

1937,10ovub5,j6k764m,MeEngineerMuchGood,"I have a number of friends who graduated in EE. They are pretty bright folks and have been quite successful in their careers after graduating.

In my experience, the engineering school is pretty good. Being in the Bay Area certainly has some advantages, IMO. It's a medium sized school, so don't expect a large school or small school feel. The EE program is very small though. I think each class has fewer than 20 people.

The immediate area is rather suburban. It's possible to get to other places (e.g. downtown San Jose, San Francisco, Santa Cruz) via public transit. If you have a car, then I'd say there is a lot to visit in the area.

San Jose is a fairly warm/mild climate. Can get in the 40s in winter and sometimes over 100 in the summer, but usually it stays between 60 and 80. It's also sunny and doesn't rain much.

Weather is probably the best part here. It's a nice sunny weather that you can enjoy. You get to experience some cold days and some rain, but nothing that pushes to extreme temperatures. 

Engineering program is great. Like most STEM courses, challenging. I can't speak for EE majors (CS major), but I enjoyed some of the courses they also take like COEN 21, which is Logic Design. Regardless, I have respect for whoever survives any major in the engineering school.

I dunno what I can say before applying. It's really up to you what you're looking for. Personally, I would just take the best financial package if it's in the major of choice.",1

It's always good to tour college campuses when they are in session and Spring Break is a good time. You might see if you can shadow a student too. UMichigan might have more offerings of things to do, as the city is built around the college life. The academics at UM will definitely be more competitive, as it's ranked #9 vs SCU #140. SCU does not have much to offer for things to do, as it's in a suburb. SF is a pit of homeless drug addicts and crime now, you probably wouldn't be visiting there all the time.

1982,zykabk,j26q28w,missionbmw,"You will here conflicting opinions when it comes to CSCI (CS in Arts and Sciences) vs COEN (Computer Science Engineering). 

CSCI is focused on higher level development, and thus glosses over circuits, physics, and hardware-software interaction. CSCI is known to have easier coursework.  

COEN is more all-encompassing. It has both the higher level programming concepts as well as the lower level.

In terms of job outcomes, they are pretty synonyms. COEN will allow you to have broader job prospects (due to the lower level skills taught) compared to CSCI, but both have great job prospects.

There isn't a published cap for the number of CS students nor how many are accepted during RD. I am confident that there are many spots open for RD, and CSCI and COEN both have around 100 students in each. 

This has financial aid resources. [https://www.scu.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/](https://www.scu.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/)

Feel free to DM if you have more questions.",4
1983,zykabk,j2b0r1v,SwedishAviator,"""CS"" in the School of Engineering (COEN) is referred to by most here as Computer Engineering, not Computer Science. Not only because the major's course code is COEN, but because we take a fair amount of electrical engineering and low-level software classes that are often not found in a regular CS degree. We still receive a degree that says BSc in Computer Science and Engineering, but I wouldn't approach it as a typical CS degree.

I should also note that because COEN majors do all of the engineering pre-reqs, not the arts & sciences ones, your freshman and sophomore years will still be really challenging, despite doing ""core"" classes. For me, PHYS 33, in particular, was really brutal. I have friends in CS that look at my work and are shocked. I am not trying to say we are better because we have a lot heavier course load (in fact, I am often quite jealous of them), but COEN does require a lot more classes to fulfill the major.

I should also note that CS is part of the Dept. of Math & Computer Science, whereas COEN has its own department. The School of Engineering has way more resources that CS cannot access, unfortunately, which is why I am highlighting such discrepancies between 2 majors that may appear similar to someone who is applying. CS' offices are in OConnor with Math, and COEN basically has its own building called Heafey-Bergin. The professors in the COEN dept. do not teach classes in the CS dept. and visa versa. 

Now with all of that being said, I don't want to scare or pressure you into picking one or the other. I have friends in both majors who love their classes. Additionally, because the credit load is lower for CS, you have way more opportunities for things like studying abroad and picking a minor unrelated to your major. Given that the job outcomes are fairly similar, this can be a pretty big tipping point for many, and I would 100% tell you to do CS over COEN if you are interested in doing non-CS-related things. If, however, you are really interested in the low-level design aspect of computing and are interested in doing additional ELEN classes, I'd go for COEN.

I'm happy to answer any more questions, and I wish you the best of luck with your application.",3

1988,zww0mm,j20eu7l,itsyaboishady,"absolutely worth it. The priority in class scheduling is no joke, you'll never face the issue of not getting a class you want, which is an extremely stressful situation and one thay happens to most non-honors freshmen",5
1989,zww0mm,j1ynqmt,usandfriends,"Congrats on your acceptance!

Yes, SCU classes are relatively small, and honors classes are even relatively smaller still. For example, one of my early mathematics courses only had 4 other students. You can’t really find a teacher-student ratio like that anywhere. Mostly though they will probably be similar size as regular courses, especially for the early core courses like CNI.

I don’t think the honors classes were that much more rigorous, I never had trouble with scheduling. Actually, I was on track to graduate a quarter early (however, the senior thesis classes kinda screwed with that). And for engineers there wasn’t much extra work needed for your senior thesis either. Also look into converting some regular courses into honors to fit your schedule, which usually just entails some extra work in the course’s final (depending on the professor). I would talk to the honors program manager to get specifics as they could’ve changed since I attended.

I didn’t feel like there was much difference in the dorms (I was in Casa for my first two years, then commuted after). I think I had some more choices than my friends but I don’t remember seeing anything that stood out. Most of my suite-mates were not honors students. Maybe someone else can speak more on dorms since I commuted the last two years. I feel like being able to apply earlier to courses was more helpful than dorm choice perks.

Overall, I would recommend it for engineers (or at least COEN specifically) because of how lax the program requirements were for engineers at the time. And I don’t think there is any penalty for dropping from the program if you find it’s too much. Again, I’d double check as they could’ve changed all those details since I attended.

Hope that helps a bit.",3

COEN vs. COEN Honors doesn't matter to an employer. And my student has had no issues whatsoever with class registration. Maybe honors students think it's great because they have priority but they don't realize that others are still getting their classes, it's not insane like a CalState or UC class registration. My freshman's registration time was two weeks after registration began so there were only 3 days left but he got all his classes but one, but just chose a comparable elective. Classes at SCU are generally 10-20, the highest are 30-40 but those are weed-out or general ed classes. SCU regular classes are not a cakewalk, kids are working, so why work harder and sacrifice the college experience?

A lot of EAs were deferred last year and this year due to the fact that ***they do not practice yield protection.*** I spoke to an SCU admissions counselor who said that they offer admission to the top applicants even though they know they will not likely attend SCU. So Early Action deferred applicants lost out to people who will probably choose an Ivy League if accepted. Maybe SCU is trying to increase their stats by offering EA to the extreme applicants. But this is not in line with the type of students SCU wants, which is well-rounded students, not only book smart students. 

I know plenty of book smart students (Ivy league/Stanford/MIT etc. grads) who are dumb at life skills; I am surrounded by them and constantly amazed at their alma maters. Successful people are more than just book smart. Even Google HR realized that the alma mater doesn't mean much, it's the person.

Even those who fit within the freshman profile stats don't always gain admission for various reasons—maybe too much competition from their school or maybe the applicants in their year had higher stats. In 2022, they said there were 1000 students who had 4.0 GPAs in EA so they offered them admission although they guessed they would choose elsewhere. SCU doesn't protect their yield, which means they do offer admission to overqualified students (""yield"" is the % of students who choose to attend their school). This left the deferred EAs to ED2 or roll over to regular decision. *Good idea to ED, that will help the application considerably.* You should hear from SCU in mid-December. Best wishes—great to have students who really want to be at SCU!",1

Now read the info on dorms and Swig . . . my son is a freshman in Swig but is on the ""better"" side. The street side is hot and noisy and for the first few months, people outside yell, ""Wake up, Swig!"" in the middle of the night. Oftentimes Swig is thought to be the party dorm but it all depends on the students, as last year the floor was wild. I think if you rank it in your top 3, you'll get it because many do not want Swig partiers. This year on his floor, hardly anyone keeps their doors open and he wanted to socialize so he joined a frat. Finn is the one people want for its newness. Dunn is next to Swig and considered social too. Read up on dorms because you'll have to rank them. Two years ago, SCU started a mandatory 2-year dorm stay rule so it wouldn't become a commuter school. But they do make exceptions.

The school had no mandatory orientation for students to meet so join clubs ASAP and put yourself out there. The students are very nice and balanced and the instructors really care, they are available to the students.",3

2148,xvqfi8,ir3hhcm,themexpride,You most likely end up writing code on paper. Many of these courses test you on how to apply the concepts presented in code that solves the problem.,1
2149,xvqfi8,ir98w85,Gatorpatch,"Generally, in my experience, you'll have to handwrite code, but it'll be more pseudocode. If you're handwriting code, then they're not looking for exact correct syntax, but they're looking for understanding of the concepts.

Focus on examples of code you've written for labs already, and just understanding how you are supposed to initialize, interact with, and especially know the timing of stuff (by timing, I mean like big-O notation). While it's been about 4 years since I was in COEN 12, I remember having to know the big-o notation of simple stuff like adding, removing, and finding certain pieces of data in the different data structures you've gone over so far.

If you have a teacher who isn't giving you info on what the exam will look like (which, tbh, that's really annoying), skim what you've gone over so far. Ask your classmates too!

Also, because I don't know how they advertise this, but stop by the peer tutor for COEN 12, according to the Tau Beta Pi peer tutoring site ([here](https://www.scu.edu/engineering/undergraduate/student-support/tau-beta-pi-tutoring/)). It's a really great resource, the tutor generally might have some inside info on what could be on the test, and they can also help answer some questions.

I know the quarter flys by, especially when it's your first quarter, but a week and a half is like such a big chunk of time in the scheme of quarters. Take a breath, evaluate the resources (the file tab on camino is your friend, those lecture slides are gimmes for figuring out what stuff is gonna be covered).

COEN classes, and most classes here, rely on a schedule that will give you a midterm week 3-4ish, another around 6-7ish, then a final. It's quick, and it can feel like it sneaks up on you, but the 2 midterm structure allows for you to have a second chance to make up lost points if it doesn't go your way. 

But, if you use your resources, and ask for help, you will find it, you just have to take the leap and ask. I did not have my shit together in 1st quarter freshman year where I was prepping a week and a half ahead of time. You're gonna be fine, and even if it doesn't go exactly as planned, you'll learn from the experience if you lean into the resources and the materials available.

Good luck!",1

2169,xiuv2o,ip54uxv,SizeDrip,"Why are you taking 7 classes as a freshman, or really just in general? Outside of labs, I don’t take more than 4 unless I really need to. Lowering the pressure on yourself by getting rid of some of those classes and giving yourself the time you need to re-evaluate your major would be beneficial :)

It’s only the first day, you’ll figure it out as you go 😊",17
2170,xiuv2o,ip5sdb5,WWRRYYYYYYYY,"How do you have 7 classes? According to the major flow charts you should have 2 BIOE classes, math, Chem, and CtW. Are you counting the labs separately?

Regardless, I don't intend to sound mean but it just doesn't seem like the school of engineering might be your thing. All of the engineering majors are more or less similar in terms of course load and although the actual number of classes you take decrease over the years the difficulty increases and in addition most if not all of your classes become major specific/STEM. 

Firstly ask your peers and see if they are struggling as much as you, chances are maybe it's just a tough professor or a hard topic.

If that doesnt work you should tell your counselor or other similarly qualified people exactly what you wrote on this post ASAP and decide whether you want to try and stick it out for a couple weeks/quarters or just cut your losses and switch out as soon as possible. Since engineering majors have so many specialized classes the longer you wait the higher the chances you might have to take additional classes to fulfil your new major requirements.

Just remember that no one is going to think any less of you as a person for switching out. At the end of the day it doesn't matter if you decide to stick it out with hard classes if you don't pass or if you get an engineering degree but you hate the major and decide to do something else as a career.",10
2171,xiuv2o,ip7a4ut,thepronoobkq,"1) 5 classes 2 labs is WAYYYYY too much, even for SoE, for freshmen. Don't burn yourself out, drop a class. 

2) Chem11 is a pretty basic class, so maybe consider tutoring with the Drahman center.

3) SoE is not for everyone. The lab’s credit does not correspond with the time needed. Don't feel pressured to stay in engineering. Its pretty easy to transfer OUT of SoE into CAS.

4) Consider your major. BIOE requires a lot of Chem. Talk to your faculty advisor (or friends) about switching

&#x200B;

HOWEVER, it is only your first week. College in general is a big change from HS. Drop a class, and stay for a few weeks to see if you want to switch anything major. A lot of classes frontload work and prep, so it usually lightens over the quarter.",6
2172,xiuv2o,ipalp7b,TrippyTreesDream,I wouldn't call it quits on the first day of class. Rather dropping that course load down would be the better option in my opinion to assure you can dedicate more time to courses you are particularly having trouble with.,2
2173,xiuv2o,iql32li,Gatorpatch,"Hey OP, I hope people didn't scare you off. I would highly recommend you talk to an advisor, but lowkey the BioE major is generally perceived as the hardest engineering major there is. I'd recommend checking out the civil engineering major (it's the smallest engineering major, even if it's not your thing, the group is tightknit and they'll give you less STEM judgy vibes if you need help), I think there's also a general engineering major, but I could be wrong.

You should take less courses for sure, because you don't want to burn yourself out early. Talk to the Drahmann center, they'll help you figure out a better schedule, and they also can help recommend what you should look at for other major options.

The quarter system is really hard, and some of the general engineering classes you will take early on are really hard too. A lot of the time, this is to weed students out that won't do the work. I disagree with this tactic, especially with the already increased stress of quarter systems, but it's important to know going in.

Chem 11 is a very hard class. It's memorization heavy, it probably doesn't feel very applicable to what engineering path you want to go into, and because it's your first quarter, you probably are utterly freaked out by how fast midterms pop up in it. However, if you're not a BioE, you probably won't have to do a ton of chem track stuff, and while they don't advertise it (because they want to weed people out of the chem track early if it's not for them, which to be clear, might be the case with you...which is like normal and ok), it's actually most likely filling your natural science requirement. There are other, less hard natural science classes that you can take that will fulfill it.

My advice is to reach out to the Drahmann center and/or your faculty advisor and ask for advice on a different stem path. Along with finding a different path, I'd recommend you start building a routine. Make sure all your midterms are in a calendar, they'll sneak up on you. Find a spot on campus that isn't your room, and make that your place to study (the SCDI is the gold standard for this). 

And most importantly, do not let struggling in your first quarter discourage you from pursuing STEM. STEM is hard, and it's made harder because it'll seem like everyone around you just kinda ""gets it"" while you struggle. While it *might* not be your thing, you've had exactly 2 weeks of class so far, are probably in a new place, with a lot of pressure to do well, and it can feel like you're the only person dealing with it. 

Newsflash! A lot of those scary engineering upperclassmen felt exactly like you did, and a lot of your peers also feel the same way. It's intimidating to ask for help, but there are resources on campus for you, and there are people around you who understand how intimidating it can feel to be new on campus.

Feel free to reach out whenever, if you have questions or need to talk to someone I'm always happy to help!",2

2225,wvpzlf,ilh298u,John6417,"Sorry for the long answer, and as a newly graduated COEN, please keep in mind that everything stated here will be said from a COEN perspective (albeit after having done academic research with the CAS CS department and having had nearly a dozen CAS CS close friends). 

Computer Science Engineering (COEN) if effectively a superset of CS in CAS. In addition to the same math courses, COENS also have to take 3 courses of physics, 3 electrical engineering classes, and a few general engineering classes. In senior year, we also have to create a capstone project with a team of other students called “senior design”. We take more programming classes than CAS CS does (verified by comparing final schedules between several seniors in both the school of engineering [SoE] and CAS), and fun fact, a nontrivial number of the upper division programming classes taken by CAS CS students are actually from within the COEN department taught by COEN professors. 

If you want to learn most of CS but have more free time, pick CAS. If you want to have a true STEM experience, and to understand the entire process of how physics leads up through printing “Hello, world!”, as well as any, all, and more of the theory underpinning CAS CS, pick COEN. COEN is undeniably MUCH busier (even when accounting for being allowed to double-dip [effectively skip] humanities courses that CAS has to take), but I found it incredibly rewarding. I did research with CAS students, and they also loved their experience mind you, albeit they did miss out on some core, traditional CS classes in the process (still crazy to me they skip compilers [and more], a cornerstone of any top CS program). 

Something else to consider are the recent changes to the internals of CS in CAS. Recent overhauls have been made to the freshmen curriculum that have 1st year students taking a class where they learn Python/pseudocode during lecture, but have to teach themselves and use C++ in labs, and they get tested on C++ in exams. This is an INSANE way to introduce CS and has lead to the massive spike of kids seeking tutoring to clean up after teacher incompetency. If this change seems unprecedented it’s because it was almost certainly pushed forward in order to reward the proposer’s career for “innovating in education” rather than actually providing any true value for students. The CAS department in general is facing a bit of an identity crisis nowadays that’s harming their capacity to operate meaningfully (especially for incoming students, most Juniors and Seniors should be insulated from this), something I sincerely hope gets better soon :/

One assumption some people make is that COEN is somehow “less theoretical” than CS. This is bullshit. COEN is exactly as theoretical (again, most top-level “CAS classes” are taken in the COEN department), in addition to which we also learn significantly more practical knowledge as well (virtually all of our COEN programming classes have labs, something the CAS folks rarely experience beyond the courses they take in the COEN department).

Lastly, the slate of COEN professors is excellent. The bar to become a professor in engineering is MUCH higher than CAS (this is coming directly from multiple CAS CS profs mind you, their words not mine), and that can seriously impact the quality of your education. Mind you, there are some AMAZING profs in CAS CS as well, however, there are also some downright ludicrous ones who will leave you tearing your hair out. This is much less likely to happen in the COEN department. 

Final summary: If you can, from a CS education perspective, you should probably pick COEN. If having much more free time is really valuable to you though, CS CAS all the way. Just keep in mind that you’re not in college to fuck off, but rather to accrue as many skills as possible. You can do both in both majors, though COEN leans more towards forced productivity whereas CAS CS depends more on student volition (if you’re to take an equivalent slate of courses to/learn as much as a COEN student)",11
2226,wvpzlf,iliscem,SwedishAviator,"As a COEN Major I do have to agree with this. I don’t want to make it seem like our program is better than CS, but from what my friends have described, their experiences have been subpar relative to the school of engineering… and this is a shame because learning about how computers work is awesome with the right professors!

I will also add that it is essentially impossible to transfer into COEN. You could always start in the school of engineering and then switch if you don’t like it as most of the intro classes will transfer their credits to the other major. The only thing i don’t really know is the acceptance rate for COEN vs the arts and sciences school. Perhaps admissions could help with that? I’m also happy to answer any other questions. Good luck!",6
2227,wvpzlf,ilkets8,themexpride,"Basically summed up just how I would've described it.

Only thing to add is the politics in the CS/Math department is tense. There's an emphasis on implementing a curve for lower-div courses (50% As/Bs, 50% Cs-Fs) and upper-div courses (70% As/Bs, 30% Cs-Fs) that apparently is policy now. This only fuels the insane coursework shown in lower-div coursework where everyone is basically relying on third-party services to learn C++. It's especially unfair for low-income, underprivileged, and misinformed students who barely start learning what a loop is. The department isn't willing to accommodate everyone nor they're willing to hire more professors to ease the growing number in the department. 

You'll meet professors who make it difficult to pass a class and make your learning experience a struggle. Some of them are the reason why the policy is in effect. Its basically going to be a miracle if the department goes through a drastic change",3

I thought it was worth it though! When I took it, I believe there were weekly quizzes or at least frequent quizzes and then weekly short writing assignments on the readings. I found the books engaging and not a drag to read. For your final, you can choose to either do a group research project on a religion or take a final exam.

Sir, I don't particularly have insider connections in these areas. Perhaps there are a few tricks I could share, however:

i) Note the post date of the job before applying. You should have a much better chance to be invited for interviews for the jobs posted within two weeks. 

ii) Craft your resume to its most meticulous form as it can be, and limit total pages to 2 (1 page for juniors). There is quite a big difference between crafting a military resume and a civilian resume. In the civilian world, we don't list every detail of past jobs, only the worth-noting and most pertinent positions with the most relatable information to the job you are applying to. As for the wording, spelling, and formatting of your resume, treat them as if you are going through an inspection: every bit of detail matters; i.e., where do you place your name, past company name, past Army role, versus how do you wear decorations and where do you place your name tag on your ASU. 

iii) Overall, your resume should be able to tell a compelling story by itself. It's your marketing material, and it carries lots of eye-catching information already. Not everybody can make it an O-6 (not me for sure) and serve in an advising role to the General Officers in the Medical Corps. Did you try contacting local hospitals to see if there are good opportunities? 

Not sure how much it helps on the technical level, but I hope it helps. For your experience level, it should work best if your connections can help. Congrats on your achievements in the Army, and thanks for your service. Hooah!",1

As with anything, there's a chance of getting a fantastic roommate or a not so great roommate, but I would set baseline expectations at friendly and accepting -- certainly nothing to watch out for from a housing perspective.

In my opinion, a single room would be far more isolating and lonely of an experience, and be the opposite of what you're looking for. I had a strong friend group and was well plugged-in on campus, and was in a single Junior year -- I found it to be a lonely and unhealthy experience anyway.

The area around Santa Clara is pretty dead, but the mall and Santana Row is fun for shopping and restaurants! There are also a lot of hikes nearby! 

If you're not into drinking and partying, there are definitely things to do that will keep you busy, but you might just have to go out of your way to ask people to do things with you. 

If you are into drinking and going out, SCU has plenty to do and you won't get bored :)",2

2443,udyu8w,i6klqme,Xeface,"Hi! I am a transfer student. Transferred from a Socal Community College this past fall quarter. I am a Junior, about to be a senior after this quarter ends.  Majoring in Finance. Looking to get into IB/FP&A/Maybe consulting.

First off, there's a link in the sidebar for the SCU discord network. As far as I know, there isn't a transfer student discord, I looked for them for a while but kept getting sent to the discord network.

So, I have really enjoyed my time here at SCU so far. They accepted pretty much all of my transfer credits (I had to retake international Econ since they don't accept transfer but they still gave me the credits in a religion class instead). The campus is beautiful, most of the buildings are nice and modern with great study spaces. Most of my classes have had great professors, especially in the finance department. Ive made some great connections with them and still regularly talk to my Investments professor. There's a pretty big emphasis from tech companies being in the Silicon Valley, so if that interests you then that's definitely a plus. Internships seem fairly plentiful, I am going to intern with a fintech company in their LA office this summer.

There's two major groups you'll want to look into: The SCIF (Investment Fund) and SCC (Consulting). Start following them on LinkedIn or instagram now so you can see their recruitment/event dates since they will start early in fall if you transfer here. Both are solid resume builders and cool experiences.

Don't really know what else to say but feel free to ask questions here or through PM if you have any specifics I might be able to answer.",2
2444,udyu8w,i6kmjxq,MarketTrader_YT,"Hey! 

Thanks for writing this detailed post. I really appreciate it! For some reason I wasn’t able to transfer directly into finance, which is why I’m not doing business economics. Nonetheless, Im glad you responded and will definitely check out SCIF and SCC! I’ll dm you for your instagram so we can stay in touch. 

Sincerely, Justin!",1

2446,udjyut,i6heqy6,ZodiacTedCruZ,"1. You can definitely minor in bioengineering, but you'll probably find it to be a lot of work alongside the COEN major. Most of the people in COEN (myself included) minor in Math since you already take so many classes in it or something not related to STEM because it's nice to diversify a little with taking so many STEM units. Lots of others also don't minor and do study abroad or something else. If you really want to minor in BioE, be sure to talk it over with your advisor since they're your best resource for that.
2. I think you'll be fine, we have the Rainbow Resource Center (RRC) and they seem like a great group of people. Even coming from a public school, the religious aspect of the school isn't super noticeable really unless you seek it out.  
3. I think it's pretty accessible, but I don't know that many people in Honors since it's not all that useful imo. Most of the people I know in it are looking to graduate early or something thereabout and the priority registration is very useful if you want to go that route.
4. Lots of profs do research, just talk to one who's doing something that seems interesting and if you have a class with them make sure to try and do well. Definetly not as selective as other universities I feel like.
5. Can't speak to work study (don't think it's super common) but it's quite easy to get a campus job and plenty of people (me included) get internships after their second year if they put in the work.

Hope that answers your questions, lmk if you have any more!",3
2447,udjyut,kzqmk8x,travs-scott,Did you end up committing?,1
2448,udjyut,i6ian29,SwedishAviator,"1. As a COEN major, I will be honest in that you are going to be very busy. It's super easy to minor in math and not too tricky to do physics. Engineering is hard so make sure to give yourself some time to decompress and have fun! The awesome thing about areas such as bioinformatics is that you don't need to have a biology background, just like software engineers at aerospace companies don't need aerospace backgrounds.
2. I often forget that SCU is religious when I go here. Religion is not forced upon you at all, and the Jesuits are an extremely progressive branch of the Catholic Church. To give you an idea, as a campus employee, I'm required to go through SafeSpace training among other things, and they do a fantastic job with it. OML and the RCC do a really awesome job at making sure people have support and resources.
3. I don't think it is impossible to get in and remember, you can still take honors classes and graduate with honors even if you are not in the honors program.
4. Research is definitely ramping up. In recent years SCU has invested a lot into grad programs and giving professors the resources to do more sophisticated research. Many of my COEN professors do some truly incredible work. If you read the faculty section of the COEN department page, you can see some of their research. In terms of STEM, the new building has dozens of massive laboratories. Difficulty depends on what the research field is, but I know a lot of undergrads that are doing work with professors.
5.  I'm not sure about work study, but I've seen a lot of fliers around campus with openings for positions that are a part of that program. As for getting a normal campus job, it's really easy. There are so many departments that are constantly hiring.

Let me know if you have any other questions!!",1

2450,udifqv,i6hjak8,I_like_to_sit,"Originally from Houston, graduated SCU years ago from the B-School. If price isn't a consideration you're in a pretty good place to evaluate fit just on how you feel and what you want out of the school.


Most people who graduate from SCU stay on the west coast. I'm currently in New England and I can count on 2 hands the number of people that I know from my time at SCU that live on the east coast. The same would be true about SMU. Most folks will stay in Dallas or move up to Chicago or to ATX or HTX. So if you like one region of the US more than another that may be something to consider. Both are near major airports so traveling outside of the country, of even domestically in the US, is pretty easy.


As for what you'll get out of the B-School, both are pretty good. So, if you get good grades and graduate you're looking at similar job prospects on the other side. The difference is, if you go into product management, tax, consulting, or any other industry centric role out of the B-School you're going to be aligned to different industries. In Texas, and especially Dallas, you're almost certainly going to get banking, energy, and ag as your primary industries that will do recruiting whereas at SCU you'll get tech and almost exclusively tech. Of course tech is an umbrella term but it's not as distinct as energy or banking.

If you plan on going to grad school, I can't speak to the prospects of SMU but SCU has some pretty good placement of folks in post grad programs. Speaking anecdotally, most people that I know from school, including myself, got into top tier (think top 5) grad programs for their field of study. Of course more goes into that than the name on the diploma but it won't hold you back.",1

I finished the finance degree classes but graduated with MIS since SCU didn't have double majors in the B school while I was there. Years ago, banks (Goldman, Citi, WF, etc) weren't recruiting directly at SCU so everyone who got jobs as quants or IBs had to do a little extra networking to make that happen.

I can't speak to SMUs ability to place folks in the banking industry unfortunately. You may be able to find that information on the career websites of each school though to see who's been recruiting in the last 12 months.",1

Note though that such is simply from an outsider’s perspective of course, and that I can’t vouch from my own experience. 

Anecdotally, I will say that there is absolutely zero tolerance for intolerance when it comes to these issues here, so I wouldn’t worry about it as a factor when making your final decision.

Every spring Queers & Allies puts on an event called Rainbow Prom, which is a ton of fun. You can find awesome people!

2492,u06o2t,i49eabg,Long_boi_123,"Hi! Yes I'm a first year student :)

The workload for a class really depends on what professor you get. After speaking with my friends I have happened to get pretty unlucky. Math so far has all been stuff the IB taught us. All my science classes have had lab portions that are pretty time intensive and tedious, but teach important lab skills.

Here are the classes I have taken so far:

**Quarter 1:**

Math 9 - Easy pre-calc stuff but they work you hard here but in the end its good.

Chem 11 - I never had chem before so it was a decent amount of work but manageable.

Religion 9: ways of understanding religion - not much work and it was easy and interesting.

C&I: History of the mind, medicine, and the body - By far the most interesting class I have ever taken but also the most work. We got 60 page reading twice a week with a graded 300 word reading response. Still no regrets that I took it tho.

**Quarter 2:**

Math 35: calc for the life sciences - Still easy, less work and easy to get through.

Chem 12 - Definitely harder. Especially towards the end but a lot of hard work and practice paid off. The professor was very supportive.

C&I (part 2): History of the mind, medicine, the body, and beauty - Somehow even more interesting than the first. Less work since the professor took our feedback from the previous quarter. Still a butt-ton of reading but very interesting. Still no regrets that I took it tho.

CTW: English - Very easy especially if you just apply a bit of TOK and normal essay skills its fine. had 3 essays each 4-6 pages long but those could be written in like a day (or if playing it risky an afternoon ;) ).

**Quarter 3:** (*current)*

Math 36: calc for the life sciences \- So far pretty easy, nothing new. A bit of a step up, but manageable. And thats saying something since I'm not the most mathematically inclined.

Chem 35 (O'chem) - Style of teaching is more conceptual and less math based, requires a decent amount of work, but so far it has gone very well.

 CTW: English - Nothing challenging so far. Will be more research paper focused but nothing new from the IB. Papers get a bit longer but similar to the previous quarter.

Bio 1A - Very very easy. Teaching is basically exactly the same as in the IB so it's next to no work. They are focused on teaching data analysis skills and basic stuff for the moment.

&#x200B;

**What I took in the IB:**

HL: Bio, Geo, English lit., physics

SL: Math A&A, German Lit., TOK

My general impression so far (aside from chem) is that the classes so far have just been catch up time to the IB. I know it is the same no matter what Uni you go to, so be prepped for the slight frustration that comes with that. I'd say the work load should be less than the IB (but not like a loooot less).

Let me know if you have any more questions! I'd be happy to help. Also I'd be open to doing a phone call if you want to get a lot of questions answered. :)",2
2493,u06o2t,jbwut6v,Long_boi_123,"Hi yeah. I am now a Sophomore and so far I would not worry too much about rigor. The IB is more challenging than most of my SCU classes so far. 

While we do still learn a lot, the amount of work you have really depends on how much work you choose to take on.
If you take on less, you can’t double major plus minors, or your grades aren’t as high, or you don’t have as many extracurriculars (to be more competitive for internships, grad schools, jobs, etc.). But you still leave with a degree. Everyone can find a healthy work life balance here.

For example I overloaded at some point and had extracurriculars, and made my life a living hell for a quarter. But I have also taken only 15 unit credits in a quarter and breezed through while living a super happy life. I have found my personal ideal at about 19 unit credits a quarter where I have some free time on weekends, to do things I love like travel, while also in the week managing clubs, or attending interesting talks. 

I would say that graduating with one major, and a good GPA is most definitely manageable for IB students.",2

Many of them are very active in the research field (my previous two both being distinguished IEEE members) and while there may be a few with subpar ratings, this is to be expected at every school. I love the smaller class sizes and the new STEM building is incredible. That being said, choose whichever environment you think you’ll do best in.

2539,tvfiwg,i8jsb4x,tm602502,"I'd love to concur with your point about SCU, but I think the general requirement classes at GT will have professors lead the lectures and TAs lead the recitations. Also, according to [this webpage](https://www.collegetransitions.com/dataverse/top-feeders-tech), GT is the 4th largest feeding college of all Silicon Valley technology workers. It outranks...a lot of schools that carry big names. Several websites provide similar ranking information, and I'm sure GT is somewhere close to Top 5, if not Top 10 anyway. Its name, by itself, would invite interviews if you craft your resume smartly enough. 

The downside of attending GT is pointed out in your answer and my previous paragraph: the class sizes are large, so it's not that easy to make your professor know you well. You would want strong recommendation letters by the time you get out, regardless if it's for graduate schools, government jobs, military, or something else. Having professors' recommendation letters is always beneficial, and it may offer you a good kickstart during the early stage of your career. 

Another benefit of attending GT is your bonds with classmates. GT is notoriously difficult with quite a bit of GPA deflation. So, it's survival mode, but anybody who can make it can make a great career. Your classmates are not only top-notch brilliant with good work attitudes (lots of them got denied by MIT, Caltech, Stanford...at least they tried) but likely to be kind and willing to help - it's a difficult journey for anybody anyways. 

Lastly, I hope everybody spends their 4-year wisely. If OP chooses GT eventually...well, it is rare for anybody to graduate from GT within four years. Then, maybe spending their 5-year wisely. Best of luck to everybody.",1

I've seen a decent number of people end up in NYC whether its for a FNAAG company and they just want to do so, or for grad school. Most people end up in San Jose, but also a pretty solid number of people in Seattle or elsewhere. With the nature of remote work, I feel like there's probably a  60/20/20 split between San Jose & SF / Seattle / Everywhere else

Not great. The school as a whole is 50/50 but COEN can be tough around 75/25.

Super supportive. If you come from a ranked or competitive high school you'll feel a drastic difference in the best way. I did not, but some of my friends who went to hyper competitive high schools in the bay area really felt the culture shift hard.

Yeah a lot of students do, its a bit harder as engineering but it just means you have to plan for it better than some random major might have to.

The clubs. I'm a COEN as well and I've been pretty involved with ACM and Theta Tau so I'd recommend you check them out.

The top houses are DG and APhi, but those are also the most cliquey. Kappa and Theta are midtier, and Adpi is the ""worst"". Despite this, I'd recommend going into rush with a totally open mind and chose the house that feels right to you!

Additionally, the vast majority of upper-division programming classes that CS students take are taught by the COEN department, most of which will be optional to CS students but required for COEN students (CS students aren’t required to take the Compilers class for example, which still to this day blows my mind since it’s a staple of CS education taught by any strong CS school). 

This isn’t to say you can’t take those advanced classes and learn a ton as a CS student, rather that you’ll have to intentionally pursue it yourself with a lower chance of entry for each course, since you’re competing against COEN students who have precedence due to needing the class to graduate. 

TLDR: By default COEN is harder because it requires you to take hard classes whereas several of them are optional for CS students. You can still take them as a CS student, but you’ll have to be proactive and fight a bit of an uphill battle

Additional note: CS is making a transition to teaching using Python and C++, whereas COEN uses C and C++.

2610,thmhuv,i18yu0r,SwedishAviator,"Depends what you’re looking for. SCU’s COEN program has very strong graduation statistics but I haven’t seen the ones for CS. I’m sure they’re good as well as we are in the bay. I’ve gotten a really strong education so far, if that makes you feel any better.

As for transferring, it’s essentially impossible to go into COEN, but CS doesn’t have a cap so you’d be able to do it without any troubles. If you really like hardware ECEN is also an option, you just gotta transfer into the engineering school first, which isn’t a guarantee.",2
2611,thmhuv,i198faj,SkipIsLBRB,"I’m someone who made this exact switch and am about to graduate. Personally from what I’ve seen, this would be a switch you would make if you were getting into technical program management or software engineering, but not necessarily product management (I haven’t applied to product management jobs, so I can’t speak on that from personal experience, but I do know business majors that have gone into product management which are very competitive jobs where a working technical background/knowledge may help you stand out so YMMV). As in regards to the ranking, it honestly does not matter that much in the long run, what matters more are the referrals you can leverage during the application process to be able to get your foot in the door for interviews. Also, if you’re on the fence and are thinking about doing a major like MIS and like the technical parts that you learn in the major, I’d definitely heavily consider making the switch to CS ASAP. Some of my closest friends are MIS majors and from what I’ve seen from their coursework and the way they talk about it the curriculum and professors are even more of a mess than the CS department, which is saying quite a lot, in addition to not learning the concepts nearly as in depth.",2
2612,thmhuv,i1d9wwz,,What's COEN?,1
2613,thmhuv,i1dmgpp,SwedishAviator,Computer Engineering. Although the degree technically says Computer Science & Engineering,1
2614,thmhuv,i1h1soq,,Oh ok I see. That's actually the major I just got in for! Do you know what the difference is between COEN and CS?,2
2615,thmhuv,i1wcog1,SwedishAviator,"COEN is in the school of engineering so you have fewer liberal arts requirements. Furthermore, it is its own department vs CS which is combined with math. My CS friends tell me that they focus a lot more on math than COEN; in other words, CS is more theoretical. Additionally, COEN has a higher credit hour, meaning you take more COEN courses than you take CS courses to earn your degree. Finally, while you can certainly do a lot of ELEN or low-level programming courses to make your COEN degree truly computer engineering, you can just as easily do almost all software classes (aside from some of the major reqs) to be essentially a CS degree, whereas, with CS, you aren't taking ELEN classes at all.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I forgot to add that since COEN is a selective major, the number of students taking those classes past the intro sequence is way more limited than CS (in theory) as there isn't a cap for CS majors.",1

Look at the courses for the majors you are interested in. Pick the one that has more classes you like. On the side, take whatever classes interest you when you have the time. If you can get a minor out of it, cool. If you can't, whatever.

If there's a field of study that's not covered by your major, but you can't get a minor, and that bothers you: look for opportunities to get involved in that area (research, internship, professors, etc.). It will look better on your resume than a minor.

If you want to be more practical, pick the major that will better serve you for whatever you want to do after college. Though, it's normal not to know, and even if you ""know"", it will almost certainly change (even if you don't think it will). So it's best to follow the first advice.",2

Imagine this: it’s 2019. Corona is merely a twinkle in Lisa Kloppenberg’s eye, and socially-distant app ordering hasn’t been invented yet. You’ve discovered the culinary toxicity of Benson the hard way, and have been living exclusively off of burrito bowls ever since you watched a rat audition for a Pixar film at the salad bar. In your hubris, you decide to try a nice pasta from PacRim. “It’s $15,” you tell yourself, “How badly could they screw up mac-n-cheese?”

Desperation shines in the eyes of the underpaid Benson worker as he reads the order from your receipt. This is a Jesuit school, and you’ve just asked him to create an abomination against God. You watch in horror as he takes a bowl of plain noodles and sullies it with Parilla liquid nacho cheese sauce. He hands you your bowl of sin, and you scurry away like the Benson rodent you are.

$15 nacho pasta is the taste of regret. It’s the pasta equivalent of your uncle who still thinks you go to UC Santa Cruz, the culinary palette of a dinner with Father O’Brien. But goddammit, you spent $15 in hard-earned FlexPoints™️. You manage to choke down half the bowl before the EMTs golf-cart you off to Cowell for psychiatric evaluation.

After the pandemic, everything changed. Nacho pasta was removed from the menu, likely over fears that it would cause the next global disease outbreak. I won’t forget, though. Nacho pasta was the only thing that ever made me proud to be a Bronco, nay, an American. God Bless Nacho Pasta.

2831,rvnunn,hs650q0,_Literally-,"You should definitely apply Early Decision 2 if you are really serious about SCU rather than Regular Decision. Top students are applying everywhere due to test-optional so if you apply ED2, your chances of admission are higher. Although with your stats, you could apply Regular and still have a very good chance. Colleges in general do prefer Early Decision students. Some colleges get 50% of their students from ED because it's difficult to predict who from Early Action or Regular Decision will choose their school. The guarantees of ED for them are easier. SCU is often a back-up school for people in the area so if you apply ED2, you are saying that you will attend their college. 

The 1/7 deadline for both has passed but you can contact your counselor and ask to change to ED2. You will need your parents and high school counselor to sign an ED2 form and submit your senior year, 1st semester grades for ED2. 

Tell your admissions counselor your situation, that you would like to be in the Engineering Dept. but if that is not possible, the CAS. They do consider emails from the students, as it's a private school so they spend more time on the applications. I think Engineering students usually have more tech resumes than CAS so that could be more competitive. But transferring into the dept. of engineering could be difficult. Ask your admissions counselor about that. You can also call their admissions dept. The people who answer the phone are impressive and very competent (other colleges usually have incompetent students answering their phones). You might get a student, but they are usually good. Oftentimes, you will reach an adult who really knows the scoop, so you can call more than once.

If you apply ED2, no, you probably won't get a scholarship. SCU gives out very few scholarships, same as USC. Ask if ED2 can be broken if you cannot afford their school. You could ask your counselor the question—don't trust me, we didn't need scholarships so are not familiar.",1
2832,rv8evz,hr63pqk,ClassicVideos,"Hi there. 

From my experience, professors are generally understanding of mental health concerns in terms of deadlines, but actual professional help is a limited resource. We have hotlines and same-day therapy appointments, but it's all for crisis response rather than crisis prevention. If a student is experiencing mental health problems that need professional intervention, they may face a very long waitlist (unless they are a risk to themself or others).

As for the student culture, everyone's experience is different. Don't expect SCU to be different than any other university just because of the Jesuit values. We were all admitted to this school mostly on academic/extracurricular records, and we aren't united by some set of altruistic values. People seek out what they desire from their college experience, whether it's party culture, athletic social circles, or anything else. 

If I were to give general advice, every college has practically indistinguishable student clubs, a health center, athletics, parties, libraries, etc. Things that differentiate them are school size, setting (urban/suburban), and resources. Do your research and find what works for you.

Feel free to ask any specific questions! Best of luck with your decisions.",10

I used to swim and this is an excellent mean to regulate mental health. Not that I needed that much, but it does make wonders to keep us calm. Once SCU staff got a word that I was enjoying using the Sullivan Aquatic Center of course they cut me out of it. I tried to insist to let me use it and they accused me of being a student in distress and sent me to a counselor.

2844,rhitej,hoqtdut,SeedlessPickles,Difficult but doable with all those APs depending on the business major you choose. Math & CS page has a checklist of class requirements and the business school also has one. You could work out potential scenarios with those. I don't think there are a ton of overlapping courses with CS & biz cause the business school has a lot of their own required courses. Hope that helps and good luck!,1
2845,rhitej,hora6ku,themexpride,You would probably need to overload credits at certain points or take Summer courses. Requirements for both schools and departments are the main reason why you don't double major with CAS and Business School. Double check on each major's requirements and spread out a 4-year plan where you commit to balancing as much courses per quarter as you can. The CS stuff is the main reason I wouldn't do this unless you literally know all the content and you don't care about GPA too much.,1

2869,r4hx28,hmi2iiy,mymingisanenema,"Hey man, what you're feeling is completely legitimate. College is a huge change, and it's can be a lot depending on your situation. 

If you're not happy, someone told me once that the three things you gotta change are you situation, your perspective, or your blueprint for happiness. I don't know enough to really give recommendations on the later two. For your situation though, you mentioned not feeling passion for anything and not feeling like you belong. It's entirely possible the major you're in isn't going to bring you joy, and that important to recognize. Finding your own ""tribe"" so to speak is also of utmost importance, and one that's been really pivotal for me in the past. The trick is to go through each of those three options for what to change with the things that make you unhappy, an answer might not always be obvious but it's a good framework to start with. 

And look, it's important that you take care of yourself, don't forget that okay? I'm certainly no therapist, I'm just a recent engineering graduate who's working now, but if you'd like someone to talk to from that perspective feel free to PM me anytime.",11

2872,r4hx28,hmibox9,SCUSKU,"Hey u/MRBobaPop, I was in the exact same spot my freshman year. I was seriously contemplating transferring during winter quarter. But what turned it around for me was finding a group of people that I enjoyed spending time around, and had the same goals, values, and interests to some degree. The way I did this was to found an engineering fraternity, but that's pretty unique to my time/place. Like others, to generalize, the main thing to do is to join or start a club/group with people that are passionate and will show up.

The engineering fraternity worked out especially well because it was an all or nothing type social engagement. Whereas clubs can oftentimes be more wishy-washy and people are more free to come and go. So take that into account. Regardless, the main thing is really to keep trying and to expose yourself to new opportunities and encounters. It wasn't until my sophomore fall that I finally felt at home. I hope you feel more at home soon. Regards.",3
2873,r4hx28,hmmu143,Sweet_Vacation4344,"Hi! I transferred as a freshman from SCU and was so happy to go home. My depression was so enhanced on campus so I know how you feel - you are not alone. I know Santa Clara doesn’t have a lot of resources in terms of mental health- I tried too. A few words of advice—
There is no harm in looking at transferring to know your options… I applied to a lot of schools who had easy transfer applications close to home 

Next, I felt like I lost all my interests coming into college at SCU. Because it is such a small school I didn’t have a lot of options - so I just explored and tried to take generic classes that would transfer! (This is freshman English, whatever math you have left , natural sciences etc) I also really liked an environmental studies course!!!

Also, confide in your friends and family and be honest about how you are feeling. The help I received from my friends at home and my siblings was more than I could’ve imagined. 

Lastly, I’ve heard of so many people at Santa Clara feeling this way— for most of them, they ended up loving it ! And a lot of people you talk to about not liking it right now will tell you that. This was always hard for me- I didn’t know if I should stick it out or not, this part is up to you. But again, just because others are super happy there doesn’t mean you will be!

2889,qupyjf,hktxq03,Xeface,"Hello, I feel like I can answer this pretty well as a fresh transfer student (came in as a junior this quarter). I'm a business student (finance) and came from a community college in SoCal.

&#x200B;

So housing isn't bad for transfers. I had plenty of options and ended up picking the Villas (juniors/seniors only townhouses). I did my housing app as early as possible. My suitemates are cool and I have my own room. Would recommend the Villas if you are willing to pay a little extra (full kitchen/laundry in unit/cheaper and gated parking etc.). Everyone in the villas are more mature and generally older, which is nice for transfers since we are typically older.

&#x200B;

Social life is hit or miss. I haven't experienced any issues with being a transfer student; people are generally nice and classmates were interested to talk about transfer stuff. I'm not a partier so can't comment on that side, however I have noticed there seems to be a SA/Drugging problem (expected at most schools tho :/) But parties are always happening near campus.

As for transition, I feel its a bit more case by case, for example I came from semesters so the quarters were a huge change for me. If you are used to quarters like you said then you should be fine. My professors have all been solid this quarter. Registering was easy and I got everything I needed both this quarter and next.

If you have any more questions feel free to respond, especially business school specific questions :)

I actually remember looking into this question awhile back and all the research I did basically concluded that passive suicidal ideation (e.g., as in thinking about wanting to die) is very common among people that seek therapy, and any legitimate therapist wouldn’t take such a dire action as referring a patient for hospitalization unless the patient expressed an imminent danger and/or clear plan to kill themself.

It’s kind of a shame because before I got here (or even applied at SCU) I was worried because I read everywhere that the food sucks. It does not at all. Benson food is good - however it’s expensive and the selection is currently not large but that’s also because of Covid.,1
2944,q9jma4,hj1t88n,nardsacks,"Personally disagree. You don’t have to be a rich kid to know that Benson food is mediocre for the price. A chicken sandwich at Benson is $12. You can get a better chicken sandwich at a Popeyes or Chick-fil-A for $3-$5. Have you seen the food they offer at other colleges and universities? The UC schools offer way higher quality food and a ton more selections as well. Schools like Duke and Bowdoin practically give their students first class meals. COVID hasn’t even made the selections much slimmer. 

Of course all colleges and universities function differently when it comes to dining, but it’s idiotic to say that Benson doesn’t distribute low-quality food for its price. Add on the price of attending SCU to that equation and you have some angry students/parents. I agree with you that Benson food isn’t “terrible”, but it’s definitely far from good, especially when compared to other schools that have a similar tuition.",3

2947,q8vrxi,hgxr8gj,roxsass,"1. The overall experience for physics is stressful. Im a 3rd physics major and i think its safe to say that the classes only get tougher as you progress through the quarters. If you have a love for physics and a great work ethic, then you can get through the major.

2. The professors are a mixed bag; some are very good at teaching and some are harder to understand. Some provide study guides and give easier exams, and some don't and have harder exams. You have more of a choice for the 31-33 (or 11-12) series but once you get to 34 and up you gotta work with whoever you get.

3. I would like to say there is a whole lot of grade deflation but all physics professors are known for making their exams difficult. They rarely curve scores when you first start but they stop doing it quickly.

4. I cant really speak on this as much because it really depends on whether or not your professors are taking on projects. Try to talk to your professors often cause even if they don't have projects, they may be able to find research opportunities for you at other universities that you can do over the summer. Check out the colloqiums they have almost every quarter to get a good idea of what students and professors have been working on. Also Professors like to take students who have finished a couple upper division classes so I'd say expect opportunities to come the summer after sophomore year. I wasn't able to do research last year because not many professors had projects going for a large part of the pandemic. 

5. I wouldn't say students are cutthroat. Everyone is more worried about themselves and how they are performing in the class. Its typically a very small class size for Physics so you'll get to get to know most if not all people within the department. Most students work independently because they find they'll understand the content better if they figure it out on their own but most people are willing to work with you if you need help, but sometimes it might be better to go to the professor if you need help. I'd recommend trying to get to know the people within your class as just talking with people in the major will help take off some of the stress. Check out the SPS club and other STEM related clubs.

Again, Physics tends to be a very difficult major so as long as you stay dedicated and use your resources to the best of your ability, you will do well. Hope this answers your question and good luck on your college search!",1

Furniture and chairs and such are nice to have, but wait until you see the room before you buy anything, again they are small rooms. As for clothes, depends on how many you have, but all of them really. If you live nearby or will stop home sometime, you could leave your summer clothes there and just bring fall and winter clothes then switch later. You can do laundry whenever you want, but keep it mind it cost like 2.50$ plus detergent for a wash and dryer cycle regardless of how much is in it. You should bring everything you think you will need/want that you cant realistically replace or get here. You can always buy soap, cleaning supplies, toothpaste, etc. here so don't need to stress that too much.",6

Plus, there are common spaces to hang out in with couches and whatnot, so unless you like to relax alone in your room, the common spaces will probably suffice.

With clothes, it pretty much depends how often you want to do laundry. Wanna do laundry every day? Then you could get away with 2 changes of clothes. If you want to do laundry once a week, then bring a week and a half worth of clothes. I do recommend a laundry hamper or bag.

If your building doesn't have air conditioning, then a fan could be useful.",6
3111,p3wnc7,h8uqbfm,Artistic_Kangaroo,"It all depends on the vibe you want in your room. You’re going to have a lot of room to work with in your Finn extended double. There’s definitely a good amount of people who bring furniture like you mentioned, just keep in mind you’ll have to do something with it at the end of the year (donate it, put it in storage, or take it with you). Because of this and because I like having empty space, I personally keep extra furniture to a minimum. My overall suggestion for you on this would be to bring less than you think and then add what you want as the year goes on.

As far as laundry, you can pretty much do it whenever you’d like. I do laundry once a week and I bring about a week and half worth of normal clothes and then a couple sets of some warm clothes and some formal clothes. The machines aren’t free but they aren’t very expensive either, like roughly 2 bucks each for washing and drying (though they always seem to be going up in price).

Thanksgiving break is Nov 22nd to 26th (M-F), so last day of class is Nov 19 and first day after break is Nov 29. Finals will be in December unless your class does something bizarre and schedules finals outside of the finals week (very rare), so no concerns there. Midterms are roughly every three weeks or therabouts but every class is different (you may only have one around week five). That being said, having a midterm the week before Thanksgiving break is quite common. You'll be able to nail things down when you get your syllabi, either when the midterms are or that they'll be floating (which makes planning travel risky).

In terms of general advice, ten week quarters are an aggressive sprint; taking off early for Thanksgiving is possible but hard at the pace some classes are moving at that point in the quarter (i.e. making up for lost ground if things have moved more slowly than expected). If you can manage it, try not to miss classes when at all possible.",6
3150,owjq7j,h9g14ok,Mac6702,"Congrats! I'm in ECP too, but for Counseling Psych. I too will give my best answers from that. 

2. Classes have been fully online since March of 2020. They have committed to in person classes starting Fall. However, professors are allowed to request exemptions so some classes may still be taught online. 

3. I was fortunate enough to get about 5 months in person before covid. I really enjoyed meeting my classmates and at least in counseling psych, there is very much a community feel and most all the students I've interacted with have been really great people. Most people are very social justice oriented and want to make real change in the world. 

5. I would say I've had 85% great faculty. All the full time faculty I've had have been great, some of the guest professors from other schools have been more questionable. In CPSY at least, I rarely have professors talk about their research and they all seem to genuinely enjoy teaching. 

6. I would say that in terms of the grad program, it does feel a bit like a commuter school. Part of that is a function of being graduate degree. There is a mix of ages, many people returning to school for a second career. People live all around the Bay Area, have kids and families, and other commitments. That said, as I mentioned in number 5, people are still very friendly and social and there are still many people who want to spend time with their classmates outside of school. It just depends on what you're looking for. 

7. I'm not sure about MATTC, but something to look into based off my experience in CPSY. They advertise our program as a 3 year program. What is not advertised is that it is really only 3 years if you take summer classes every year. Just something to look into for your program. Hope that helps!",2
3151,owjq7j,h85sqdk,brazucadomundo,"I'm from the engineering school, so I will answer only what I can apply:

2 - They were entirely online until Winter 2020, a few on-campus classes for Fall 2021, back online for Summer 2021 and will be mostly on-campus from Fall 2021.

3 - During the pandemic there was next to no personal interaction between students outside classes.

5 - They care more about their salaries lol. There is little research at SCU, at least in the Engineering department, and the teaching is not really that great either. It feels more like the students are there only for the OPT.

6 - They kicked all students from the fitness center for summer, so that shows how much they really care about students being on campus. You could rent a place on campus, but frankly, it is not worth it. There isn't much what to do on campus, you will head to the city for most of what you need to do.

7 - I can't tell about your program, but if you are a California resident you are better off going to a public university, like SJSU or to the UC system. The tuition fees at SCU at very high. It is only worth it for international students trying to immigrate to the US.",1

The way it works is you basically buy nonrefundable ""meal points"" which can only be used in the Cafeteria and a couple cafes on campus. One meal point costs one dollar, and at the end of the quarter you can only roll over 100. The places on campus take credit cards and flex points (which you can load anytime) not just meal points, so it's not like you'll starve if you run out, but if you have extra meal points that you can't carry over then you'll lose then and then you're basically just giving Bon Appetite and Santa Clara free money.",5

3190,os8lpy,h6mxn03,John6417,"Senior CSE here. My understanding is that such typically only happens after at least a quarter at SCU, though it’s much more common after your freshman year has passed. As an engineer you’ll be assigned both a faculty and peer advisor to help guide you through SCU — should you intend to switch, they’ll be your two best resources in guiding you to do so (don’t worry about seeking them out as you’ll receive information later on as to where/when to meet them). 

As a heads up, though you almost certainly already know this, CSE is a heavily impacted major — it can be exceedingly difficult to make it in, despite being the largest engineering major at SCU. However, there are a few things you can do to tip the scale in your favor: 1) be polite but adamant. You have to be your own advocate in college, make sure your desire is heard and your motivations understood. 2) exceed academically. Even if you’d rather not be in BioE, you’ll have a MUCH harder time getting into CSE if you have poor grades — the limited number of seats tends to mean that top students have a much easier time getting through. 

By the time freshman year ends, most of those who picked CSE for the wrong reasons will have dropped the major, making for more openings. And while you certainly should advocate to switch ASAP with your faculty and peer advisors, prepare yourself mentally that you’ll most likely end up having to spend at least a year doing the major you signed up for beforehand.",2

3248,oks77e,h5gfnjw,SCUSKU,"Hey /u/redevil2003, I did my BS/MS @ SCU focused on computer vision, now work doing ML. 

My first question to you would be, why do you want to do ML/DL/AI? It is a really hyped up field and I think a lot of prospective students are attracted to it for the wrong reasons. I would encourage you to explore other fields within CS to see what interests you! There's a lot that SCU offers to explore. 

With that said, most machine learning these days uses Python. People also use C/C++ for real time/embedded applications, SQL for data science, as well as R, but Python is the big one.

Regarding the ""essentials"" of the language, you will pick up on things if you continually use the language (whichever you pick). There is a lot to learn and will take time to build up enough of an understanding to start doing ML beyond just following a tutorial.

I would say more fundamental is calculus, linear algebra, data structures and algorithms, digital signal processing (for computer vision) and the ability to read and process research papers. The programming is really just a method of implementing math. 

Finally, if you are truly interested in doing cutting edge ML research, you will have to do a PhD. If you want to work in the ML/AI/Deep Learning(DL)/Data Science (DS) spaces, you will most likely need a Master's at minimum. So also be prepared for that reality, because you will have to stand out from other candidates interested in the space, as it is highly competitive.

Hopefully I haven't crushed your spirits with my response. I think the biggest thing to do while in college is just to explore what interests you and makes you happy. That will be the best for your career in the long term. Because if you truly are happy doing say, frontend web development, you will spend your free time doing it and become better than others. Cheers!",3
3249,oks77e,h5aed3t,SjWArrior30,I think with any developer Job you should know data structures and algorithms pretty well. I’m not too sure which languages they use but you can like go to indeed/LinkedIn search a position your interested and maybe look at some entry level and new grad roles or internships and see what they require,2
3250,oks77e,h60nq3t,quan734,"Hey there,I am currently a senior at SCU. Doing CS with Deep Learning emphasis (i created one for my own with the department of math/CS), and an AI Resident at one of the AI Residency program. You have to understand the difference between software developer and AI/ML Scientist, they are two completely different fields. While the AI/ML field needs people who can code, but that is just 5% of what we are doing everyday. Traditional ML is not really that useful right now except some regression and things like t-SNE or PCA, most of the AI we are seeing right now is from deep learning. To be successful toward an DL career, a MS degree is also a must, except you are one of the outstanding with a lot of researches or internships. If you are working toward a research career (which you should because DL Engineer is boring, you just load weights from ImageNet or BERT that were trained by Google or FB and retrain on your company's data LMAO), phD should be considered

.However, do not just focus on the CS side. DL/ML, 90% is calculus and probability. Architecture nowadays like CNNs, Transformer, etc. are easy to deploy with PyTorch/TensorFlow, but understand the math behind them is extremely important. Imagine the ImageNet dataset has 1 million images and took google a week two train on 8 TPUs (each costs \~$10k). So if you do not understand the math behind Deep Learning, you will waste a lot of your time on training but will give you a really bad model (either underfitted or overfitted) and you have to train everything again, not just time but money too because training these models will probably need GPUs from AWS or GCP.

Advice is to start with something easy (Coursera courses from Andrew Ng is Amazing). But most of the time, expect to learn things by yourself, SCU does not offer a lot of AI/ML classes at the undergrads level.",3

1) What skills do I need to have in my portfolio to land a job at a Microsoft, Google, Apple, Tesla, etc? 

2)does SCU help you attain these skills or is it going out of your way to do so? If you do need to go out of your way, which websites do you suggest? I heard somewhere that SCU focuses on C & C++. 

3) Which programming languages do these companies use? Is Python good enough? 

4) What, in your experience, helped you the most in your professional life that you did in college? What do you hope you would have done, and what do you wish you hadn't? 

So sorry for this extensive list of questions, just quite anxious about the whole process, and hoping to make the most of it!",2
3261,okfzkh,h5f54z1,John6417,"1. Skills that helped me included those accrued from programming recreationally every day at college. Some folks try to score an interview by grinding on leetcode/hackerrank, but it turns out that if you program a ton on your own you can completely circumvent such. 

Additionally, I went into Microsoft with 3 years of software development experience at a startup. Whereas the personal projects have me the skills to pass the technical questions, the interviewers themselves focused almost entirely on my time at the startup, how I worked with the team, how I made decisions in weighing pros/cons, what design choices would I have changed looking back in order to boost security and performance, etc. This is why in addition to applying to big tech companies after your freshman/sophomore years (which is effectively a roulette wheel since they prioritize juniors for the “real” internships in order to try and recruit them as full time employees if you perform well) you should also consider applying to smaller, less known companies in order to accrue experience that will make you stand out among your peers to big tech. 

2. SCU a will help you with establishing a foundation for general programming knowledge, as well as put you geographically close to larger companies such that they’ll all show up to recruiting events. While I think their curriculum is great, I wouldn’t be a third of the programmer I am now without programming in my spare time as well. Websites that come to mind include teamtreehouse.com, a paid service that SCU’s ACM club (the CS club effectively) has an account for (I can ping you the login info if you’d like). But tbh, most websites are only going to teach you things like “how to use X language or framework”, and while doing so is certainly step 0, bigger corps don’t care as much about what languages you know or don’t know — I mean, it’s a bit ambiguous right? If I come out of SCU I can say I learned C++, but if someone else has industry experience in the language for 30 years, they’d kick my ass! “Knowing the language” or “knowing the framework” has to be quantified in order to be meaningful, and this is done by personal projects or internship experiences — the former of which can be done entirely on your own! SCU will do a great job of showing you the various metaphorical pools of computing, and you’ll dip your toes in all of them, but it’s up to you to plunge head first by experimenting with what you learned and researching into it even more in your spare time in order to accrue a significant skill set. 

3. Programming language use ranges from Python to JavaScript to Java to C++ to C# etc. When you start programming, everyone (including myself) thinks that knowing languages is a key part to programming, and that the language determines where/what you can work on. And this is true to a particular extent — you aren’t going to be writing a kernel in smalltalk — but it’s much more important to become adept at algorithmic thinking and having a broad understanding of systems in place (how does a computer work, how does the internet work, etc) than knowing any particular language. Languages are good at getting you to think in a particular way and enable you to use a particular set of tools, but it is exceedingly rare though to have a project in industry now that only uses one! My recommendation would be to learn a variety of languages in order to learn a variety of ways to think (this will help with cultivating a capacity for algorithmic thinking). Anecdotally I can say that learning new languages has absolutely influenced the way I program in my previous languages, for the better! As such, only knowing one language to understand computing is a bit like trying to see a gorgeous landscape while looking through a straw. 


4. I’m a rising senior, so not quite done with college yet lmao. Thus far learning to work on a team and thinking algorithmically has been the most helpful (as well as knowing git inside and out lol). Those two concepts may seem vague, but they are concretely realized by being able to effectively work with others in group projects at school, as well as work on personal projects on your own (respectively). Moreover, I’m fortunate enough such that — thus far — I have no regrets about my time at school. Since day 1 I was the one sitting at the front of class asking tons of questions, squeezing the most I could out of my education. This helped me connect with professors, as well as peers (if you demonstrate your knowledge and engagement with classes by participating, people will come to you to be in their study sessions). As such I got meet many other folks that were similarly invested in their own academic success, which is a fantastic resource to have when it comes to studying for more challenging courses :). The main piece of advice I have is to be relentless in your pursuit of knowledge — DO NOT BE AFRAID TO ASK QUESTIONS — and take the reigns of university in order to be the driving force behind your own education. Do not lie back and passively attend classes expecting to come out as an amazing candidate — success lies in taking an active role in your understanding and exercising of course material (and beyond!). 

Lmk if you have other questions!",5
3262,okfzkh,h5axuh6,lawfulpossum,"1. Depends on the role you’re going for. There’s different fields within swe. Generally, they like seeing prior technical internships, relevant projects, and awards (scholarships, hackathons). 

2. University will teach you how to be a better programmer. CS at SCU focuses on math and theory so a lot of languages and frameworks you’ll have to learn on your own. I suggest researching what job position you’d like to land in the future, looking at what languages they use, and building some projects using those languages off of YouTube tutorials to start off then building your own original projects by looking at documentation. 

3. Python is rly good for data science and ML. You don’t have to learn extensive amounts of languages and technologies. You need to learn the ones that are relevant to the field you want to work in. For example, in mobile app development you might use Swift, Kotlin, Java, React, Angular, etc. 

4. I’m an incoming freshman just like you. I don’t have a lot of professional experience. Take a look at r/csmajors they answer this question extensively 

Actually all of these questions are answered extensively on r/csmajors and other cs subs. I would check those out",3

3265,okh84c,h58i53y,John6417,"If you have credit for COEN 10 & 11 you’d either take COEN 12 or ELEN 21 (also listed as COEN 21) next. Opinion can be split in my experience as to whether you should skip COEN 10 & 11 — even if you have the credits — if you don’t have experience in C. IMO it fundamentally comes down to how driven you are in self-directed learning: COEN 12 is taught under the assumption that you already know the C language (it’s what COEN 10 and 11 are for), with an understanding of basic concepts like pointers, structs, arrays, types, basic use of the standard library, control flow mechanisms, and manual memory management being taken for granted. Whereas much of these are similar to Java, some aren’t (think pointers). Should you brush up on these in the summer/quarters prior to taking COEN 12, you would likely do ok, but I will say that anecdotally I’ve heard way more people regretting that they didn’t take COEN 10 and 11 prior 12 than folks that are glad they managed to skip it",4
3266,okh84c,h5aygaj,lawfulpossum,"Yeah I was worried I might not know enough C lmao. I’m teaching myself right now. I’ll try to learn as much as I can before school starts and if COEN 12 is too much for me after the first week I’ll drop. Thanks so much

Also: are there multiple profs teaching the course? Can I ask who taught your class and if you’d recommend them?",1
3267,okh84c,h5f0fxl,John6417,"I believe the prof I had was Liu Liying, though I may have the spelling a bit off. Which prof teaches the class is dictated by which quarter your taking it in — Darren Atkinson teaches it in fall, and then two additional teachers cover it in spring (including the one I had). The only way to know for sure who is teaching what is by checking course avail. 

Note that if you check courseavail now it’ll say that COEN 12 with Atkinson next fall is full, but that’s likely just closed prematurely in order to save space for incoming freshman (not sure though)",2

3275,ojjzxr,h524rxb,SjWArrior30,I think CS in engineering requires more units to graduate and has a senior design project. I don’t think there’s two much of a difference both are good options. It should be easier to transfer to arts &sciences very difficult for school of engineering,3

3277,ojjzxr,h614kdb,thepronoobkq,"1) The School of Engineering is more STEM than Arts/Sciences and you can skip/double-dip some core requirements as an engineering major. According to my boss at Intel Labs, Silicon Valley companies like Computer Engineering over CS. I also think the CS track has more math (I could be wrong).

2) From what I understand as a Computer Engineering major, its hard to transfer into the engineering school because of the higher demand. 

3) If you transfer to SoE, it definitely matters. Engineers have very different cores then Arts/Sciences and the rest of SCU.

4) SCU is a feeder school for Silicon Valley, so I wouldn't worry much about the rankings.",3

3281,ojjzxr,h53mqr4,,"Keep in mind that major title doesn’t matter in the long run, it primarily comes down to experience and personal knowledge you aspire to gain from outside of classes to drive yourself in your desired career path which I can already tell you understand.

The goal of college is to supply baseline knowledge for jobs which scu is clearly doing but always assert your individuality, creativity, and knowledge to do what you want towards your future. Treat SCU like a networking hub to meeting other like-minded folks for the sake of your interests and passions.

No recruiter or HR person will look at a college students resume and see grades as a make or break. For starters, without real work experience, the GPA is really the most standard thing that they could judge you on.

Now if you don’t have any external interests (groups, etc.), no internships, no research or papers submitted, no documentation and code explaining your projects, basically nothing on your resume beyond the classes you took and the GPA, the employers might raise some questions as to if you had to cut everything else out of your life to keep that GPA or not (which could be a sign of burnout).

This would probably come through in the interview part and if you come across as personable or not. Also, not every company is looking for the same thing so one person’s ineptitude or awkwardness might be the perfect fit.

I would suggest having more interests and expanding your external activities as the difference between a 3.95 and a 4.0 is negligible but the difference between a resume with just classes and a GPA versus one with lots of do-it-yourself activities and  (especially leadership roles) and a slightly lower/very mediocre GPA will likely go to the one with the larger pool of experiences.",2

As for GPA , just do your best but take classes with a grain of salt. They won't make or break your chances of obtaining an internship but if you're aiming for FAANG-type positions they might on top of your first-hand programming experience and charisma.

About projects, school related like undergraduate research is still highly regarded as you would voluntarily put time out of your summers/school year without treating it like normal school, making you stand out amongst peers. But school projects like labs won't impress as much because it occupies the same time you practically have in school and doesn't show much of what you do outside of class.

In our LSB transfer student event there was less than 10 of us for the finance program, and about 70 or so in that meeting, not sure how Indicative of how many students were accepted. The meeting was supposed to be attended by anyone who got in to SCU as a transfer student for the business school. 

For best route, I’m not sure. Like I said I chose finance because that’s what I am interested in, so I would just chose what sect of business you are interested in and choosing that. (I can’t remember if they offered alternate major choices)

3363,o6loit,h34olnk,Smooth_Operator4614,Thanks for this detailed reply. If I get a 4 or 5 in AP CS exam then I can skip CSCI 10 and same for Math 11 and 12 based on my AP Calc BC exam. What other courses should I take instead if I skip these courses? Also are 4 courses the max for any quarter or just for freshman year?,1
3364,o6loit,h2wyiky,asodah,"I am a freshman currently in the business school, my first quarter was:

&#x200B;

BUS 70 ( the required freshman business school class)

Business Ethics

CTW

Math 30

&#x200B;

BUS 70 is a requirement in the business school and you need to take CTW, RSOC, C&I within your freshman year aswell. I took math to get it out of the way.",2
3365,o6loit,h35ex0h,Swapan280,Keep in mind that I only finished first year so I didn’t take many classes. In general I loved RSOC 9 with Professor Sarita Tamayo-Moraga and would recommend her to everyone because she’s simply amazing. I’m also glad I did Spanish online and completed by second language requirement. But I do wish I overloaded for winter quarter but regardless I don’t have to many recommendations as everything was online.,1
3366,o6loit,h2usumu,Swapan280,Honestly just make sure you are completing all the courses that is found in your degree audit. You can find the core credit classes under this website [https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/](https://www.scu.edu/provost/core/).,1
3367,o6loit,h2w8oub,Swapan280,"So the programming language that you will be focused on for CSCI 10, 60, 61 is C++. It’s similar to Java so don’t worry about it. Also as I said you have the space for four class so in the two spaces you have you can take religions, Cultures, or CTW. Check the link I sent you for any of the classes under that category. Also you will be pre-enrolled in some class (mine was RSOC 9 for religions) so technically you would need to pick our 3 classes including lab for CSCI 10.",1
3368,o6loit,h34pwm2,Swapan280,"Ya also if u skip Math 11, you will be in Math 12. And you will take four classes but if your GPA after fall quarter is over 3.3 (non-honors) then you can take 5 classes.",2
3369,o6loit,h34ps1g,Swapan280,Do not skip CSCI 10. Java and C++ are different and the classes are different and more intensive. I also took AP CS A but I would have definitely failed the other courses if I didn’t start from CSCI 10. I don’t recommend anyone to skip that class.,1

3391,o01ay5,h1swuhw,ElGainsGoblino,"You spend points to purchase food/meal items from Benson and the cellar market. You can spend as many or as few points as you'd like per day. There is no set number of alloted ""meals"" that you get. Try to budget how you spend your points in the same way you'd budget your finances to purchase food outside of school. To help with this, there are little posters around Benson that show recommended amounts of points that you should have left each couple of weeks to avoid running out before the end of the quarter. Think of this as a reference, not a strict requirement. If you do run out, you can always upgrade/add points during the quarter, but try to avoid this. At the end of the fall and winter quarters, some points rollover (I can't remember the amount). For what it's worth, I used the basic plan and always had a couple hundred points leftover by finals week. If by the end of the quarter you still have more points than the amount that rolls over, spend it on non-perishable food at the cellar market or else those points go to waste.",6
3392,o01ay5,h1te6sk,stickleaf,Was not nearly enough for a lot of people. If you eat 3 meals a day there it will be a stretch.,2
3393,o01ay5,h1vt6e6,Kevel714,"FYI 1 point=$1

If you're able to spend less than 8 points per meal you should be fine but from what I recall most food options are 10 points. 

Just a recommendation. You could eat breakfast (milk, juice, fruit, etc...) in your dorm if you have access to a fridge and use your points for lunch and dinner. That's what I did and didn't really have to worry about running out of points.",2

3400,o01ay5,h1umhbv,CharlesStross,"Personally I think it depends on how you eat. Are you having a three egg omelette with extra advocado and a breakfast burrito every day, and lunch and dinner similarly massive meals? Yeah, you might run low towards the end of the quarter. But if you don't treat it like a restaurant every day for every meal and buy, ya know, a bowl of cereal and some fresh fruit or a regular omelette as your default breakfast, you'll be totally fine.

What makes SCU more “explicitly liberal” is the core requirement “Experiential learning for ***social justice***”. Social justice, according to German philosopher F.A. Hayek, is a [bad thing](https://youtu.be/rtBvQj2k6xo).

The ELSJ requirement is supposed to teach the students to understand how painful the world is through looking at the more terrible societies and what the students can do about it to improve the society, including underserved populations. While I am not against people helping out underserved populations, it shouldn’t involve redistribution, exploitation, or even extortion from the better societies.

>As I communicated to you in my letter on March 18, 2021, Father O’Brien was placed on leave by the USA West Province and an independent investigation was conducted on behalf of the Province. The Province has advised the Board of Trustees that it has concluded its investigation which found Father O’Brien engaged in behaviors, consisting primarily\[1\] of conversations, during a series of informal dinners with Jesuit graduate students\[2\] that were inconsistent with established Jesuit protocols and boundaries. The Province also advised the Board that alcohol was involved and that no inappropriate behavior was found in any settings outside of these dinners.\[3\]The Board of Trustees takes this situation very seriously and fully supports those who came forward to provide their accounts.In light of the findings, the Province directed Father O'Brien to remain on leave and to enroll in a four- to six-month therapeutic outpatient program, which he has now begun, to address related personal issues, including\[4\] alcohol and stress counseling.

A few observations:  
\[1\] ""...consisting *primarily* of conversations"" = something other than talk was inappropriate.  
\[2\] O'Brien's ""behavior... in certain social settings with adults"" becomes the board chair's ""a series of informal dinners with Jesuit graduate students."" NOTE: O'Brien does not include an apology to these students in his statement.  
\[3\] The board chair's statement does not note the scope of their investigation, so we don't know how meaningful it is that inappropriate behavior wasn't found beyond the dinners. Did the investigation extend to other institutions where O'Brien worked, for instance?  
\[4\] ""...including alcohol and stress counseling"" = something in addition to alcohol and stress counseling is being addressed.",5

Another thing I would run the numbers on is what the expected income is for someone with a management degree is. From that number you can estimate roughly how long it will take to pay back those loans, seeing as you will not be able to shed them via bankruptcy.

If I were in your shoes, I would just really need to justify to myself why it is worth $50k of student debt, with the expectation that the ROI will easily pay for itself.

Doesn't necessarily mean you couldn't do the same with a degree from a cheaper school, but I think the chances that you get a COEN degree from SCU and then are unable to find a job are slim.

Generally speaking, I enjoyed my SCU experience, but it can take time to find your niche. I found my niche in extra-curriculars and Residence Life, but always felt out of place in the off-campus party scene. SCU's location is such that there really isn't a lot to do in walking distance of the school, but a bus, car, or train ride away can land you in SF, state parks/forests/beaches, malls, commercial areas, etc. Housing-wise, I think the on-campus housing is really nice (but expensive); and when I was at SCU the campus dining was pretty good in terms of health, taste, and variety.

But even with just engineering, I've definitely had a few professors who ranged from ""swell and knowledgeable person who sucks at teaching"" to ""don't care about the class and teaching."" For the most part it's that the bad professors teach various required classes, so you end up having those bad professors multiple times. I'm speaking from my own experience in MECH though, so most of my engineering professors were from the MECH department. 

One piece of allegorical experience though, my old roommate in COEN had a COEN class once where he actually did better when he decided to stop showing up to lectures and just read the textbook. Apparently everyone who went to the lectures was having a really tough time, but my roommate (who isn't a good student) managed to do really well in that class. Take this with a grain of salt.",3
3545,n77l2i,gxf5p7d,MeEngineerMuchGood,"I suppose I wouldn't say that 10-20% of the teachers are bad so much as 10-20% of classes have bad teachers. Sometimes a bad professor teaches multiple required classes, so you get stuck with them more than once. And to be fair, I'd say that my experience was probably better than many of my peers because I had priority class registration, so I was usually able to avoid the bad professors. I probably had more like 5-10% bad professors, but I'd adjust my estimate for the general population to more like 10-20% cause of the bias from my experience.

This all said, I think 10-20% bad professors is really good; I'd expect that number in the general population of professors in the US to be more like 50% based on nothing more than the fact that by definition 50% are above average and 50% below.",1

I'll note that based on my experience, in the cases when a professor is a bad teacher, more likely than not it's either because they are a tenured professor (aka can't be fired) who has checked out on the teaching side, but may still be a great researcher (which can be good if you want to do research with them) or they are a bad adjunct professor (aka temporary) that SCU is stuck with because the market for lecturers in that field is tight, which would affect other schools too.

It's doable if you have the motivation. You'll probably have to overload a few quarters (depending on overlap), but it's generally manageable. I think the max units per quarter is typically 19, but I averaged a bit more than that. They'll make you go in for academic advising if you try to overload, but as long as you're doing well enough, they'll grant you the permission to overload.


Honestly my biggest issue was taking enough core classes, since I generally didn't have as much motivation for that as I did for my major specific classes. I was also able to study abroad without impacting my plan too much, so that's still an option even if you want to double major. 


Is it worth it? Hard to say, it's a bit subjective. Objectively it probably wasn't worth it for me, but I wanted to prove to myself I could do it. If I went back in time, I'd probably do it again though. But I'd definitely take core classes a lot sooner. I took 8/9 core classes my senior year, and that was a bit rough lol.

3584,n46lvn,gwun2b7,Futureproducer99,"Honestly I don’t think you can necessarily go wrong with any one of them, covid led to the demise of all the ones that were struggling with housing and getting new members, so all the remaining frats (pike, Sig pi, Calphi, Sig chi, TKE, Kappa Sig, and ZBT) have at least one good house and throw parties/mixers regularly. You’ll have a great social life in any one of them, so don’t just pref based on “ranking” and pick the one that you genuinely see yourself being a part of and like the guys in. Rush isn’t until the winter, so my best advice is to spend fall quarter getting to know the various frats/guys in them and rush the ones that you vibe with the most.",8

3586,n3gw68,gwq8zq0,Artistic_Kangaroo,"I think the food is actually not that bad (at least compared to other schools), it’s just kinda standard for the most part, the worst part is the price. Some things are actually pretty good (chicken sandwich, Buffalo cauliflower, +some others), but some are quite terrible (cooked salmon, quinoa that comes half cooked, etc). If you don’t go at peek time it’s convenient in that if you want something like a generic burrito or bowl of pasta, you can get it in like 5 minutes. There are usually specials as well, but overall my advice is just to try everything and I’m sure you will be able to find stuff you enjoy, the food is by no means inedible or unbearable. 

As other people mentioned, there is also a small grocery store called the cellar which is great for changing it up, getting snacks, or buying (albeit limited) ingredients for cooking. While it is equally as over priced as the “restaurants” upstairs, it’s still good. I usually get snacks and sandwich supplies there. 

Then of course there are off campus options which don’t take meal points, so you’d be paying extra to eat there. I usually end the quarter having just used all my meal points but I barely ever eat off campus (maybe 1-3 times per quarter), so eating off campus is not necessary if you’re strapped for cash. It’s nice to treat yourself if you’re able to every now and then, especially after a tough exam or project, but don’t feel like you have to - I usually just go with friends when they go sometimes.

Overall the food is good (as in an average of 7/10) in my opinion, unless you’re a picky eater. Sorry for the long reply, but I love eating so I couldn’t help myself :)",13

3591,n3gw68,gwq8dif,,"So the ""food court"" is like 5-7 ""restaurants"" all run by bon appetite. They all specialize in one cuisine, so there is a pizza one, burger, Mexican, Asian, maybe 2 more I cant remember and a salad bar. Their menus are small, maybe 5 things each that never change, making them all old fast. They do have some rotating stuff but it will only be one thing on any given day. Depending on the day and time, they all wont be open, only a few will. After dinner for example, only the burger place is open and they only have like fries and mozzarella sticks. This isn't a problem if you eat at normal times but depending on class schedule you can get kinda screwed if you eat lunch at 2-3. The overall food quality is poor, taste like cafeteria food not restaurant quality, maybe subway tier. If your not picky a lot of people are ok with it but its just not good.",3

3613,n1oeug,gwgo6qq,,Yes it is more about politics. I want to be as respectful as possible of everyones opinion but i dont want to be forced to follow the same political views in order to make friends or get a good grade in a class and i have heard many stories of students getting bad grades for having different opinions than a teacher. Itd make me feel better to know open and civil debate is possible and different view points are respected.,2
3614,n1oeug,gwpy8vj,Asadiani,"I'd say it's all about how you present yourself and how respectful you are to others. If you come arms swinging as an unapologetic Trump supporter who wont shut up about making America great again, then you'll have problems. It's all about being civil, intelligent and knowing how to read the room.  The reality is that academia is heavily liberal, and that's especially true on a Jesuit campus.

Most teachers will encourage debate, but some will make your eyes roll. I also know several people who had threats made against them, or had campus safety falsely called on them, or were targeted and bullied because of their views. Sadly, that's just the reality of universities today. Before you start challenging the status quo, be respectful and see how people respond to contrarian views. If they are open to Socratic debate, then game on. If not, steer clear.

That said, I was a recent Arts and Science grad who leans to the right politically, and I had plenty of political discussions both in my classes and with my friends. I was very cautious about which professors or students I debated, but I never really felt it hurt my social life or my ability to get good grades. For better or worse, most people are fairly agnostic politically and won't care about your politics. As long as you're not in their face about your views and can read a room (which many fail to do), then you'll be fine. 

Good luck, it will always feel like an uphill battle and you'll rarely change anyone's views.",6
3615,n1oeug,gwhcbx4,John6417,"Disclaimer: this is 100% anecdotal and hence should be taken in with a heap of salt and as many other opinions as possible. 

In my experience it can depend on the department. In engineering, it’s never been an issue (politics doesn’t really come up when everyone’s already busy banging their head against the wall trying to understand electricity and magnetism) but I have had 1 Professor who would flat out fail students that disagreed with her views in the English department. To be clear, I’m a junior and this has only happened with one professor, so it seems pretty rare. 

Your first instinct may be to politely explain your perspective or confront the professor about their bias — perhaps even bring it up with the department chair given their behavior is unethical and a violation of the university’s grading policy. And this is commendable, you’re doing what intuitively seems right. My advice: don’t. Not everyone is open to such, and the professor’s perspective is NOT worth tanking your GPA over. Real talk, the situation is rare enough such that should you be unlucky and experience it, just roll with the class and say what you have to in order to secure a good grade. 

In terms of other students, politics typically isn’t brought up. I’d personally recommend you not bring it up either, but hey you’re an adult now so that’s up for you to decide. 

Can’t speak for the business school as have no exposure to such. Again, this is just 1 experience, so please account for any others as well.",4

I think CS majors can do research with CSE, but I wouldn't quote me on that. There is a lot of overlap in the programs ( a lot of the classes are overlapped) but they are in completely different departments. 

and unfortunately, no. The new building isn't for CS. not even for CSE. The building opposite of it, the temporary Engineering building (Heafey-Bergin) will probably be where most if not all of the CSE department is going to be. CS is more closely related with the math department (which is in O'Connor), so many of the professors' offices are going to be elsewhere.

3688,mrikx2,gw6nr0d,John6417,"Let me start off by apologizing for the length lmao

Anecdotally, managing a full course load and more in conjunction with side projects has been 100% feasible — of course, there will be times where you’ll have to hunker down on your academics (think midterm/final seasons) but overall there’s plenty of opportunity there. 

For me the “secret” as it is would be to truly enjoy programming. Not something that comes easily when you first learn it, certainly, but stick with it and you could be very surprised. Enjoying programming means that side projects won’t be a burden, they’ll be a hobby — a mechanism to wind down after a busy day/on weekends, thereby making it much more enticing to pursue (rather than just doing it for the sake of a better resume/CV). 

However, my experience is going to be skewed here as I only started working a job while in undergrad relatively recently (this year as a junior in fact) and as such the amount of time this will take from your studies/projects will be entirely determined by the context of your employer. 

If you’d like to do said work in the programming field, then awesome! If I’m honest this will be damn near impossible as a freshman and still VERY difficult as a sophomore, unless you already have some demonstrable skills/experience in programming as it is. I’d personally recommend (though this is just imo so please get other opinions as well :)) you stick to improving your academic and programming skills via projects throughout your first 2 years, then hit up the market for programming-specific careers. 

That being said, I am in contact with a startup in Redwood City that I did a bunch of JavaScript work in during highschool and after my freshman year, so if you’d like to work in software and can’t find anywhere else to turn over the summer after your freshman year hmu and I’d be happy to connect you.

In support of the residential nature of Santa Clara, and the University’s commitment to integrated education, all unmarried, full-time undergraduate students are required to live on campus during their first and second year, unless the student has been approved for an exception or space is not available to accommodate this requirement. **Class year is based on total academic years in college**.  **On-campus residency is required until a student is in their third year of college.**
Exceptions to the residency requirement are considered based on medical or religious conditions which cannot be accommodated in on-campus accommodations, situations in which living on campus would result in severe financial burden or family hardship and exceptions for students who live with immediate family in their primary residence within 30 miles of campus.

Most professors are pretty accommodating in terms of office hours, and I would suggest taking advantage of that as much as you can/need. Someone gave me this piece of advice before coming to SCU, and I didn’t take them as seriously as I should have. 

In terms of internships and jobs, my friends and I have had a relatively OK time finding opportunities. I’ve been working Part-Time for the past year and I’m currently applying for a full-time job. I haven’t really experienced any issues regarding SCU’s name recognition. Many of the companies I’ve applied to have had a fair share of SCU alumni who work there as well. 

If you do choose SCU, my advice would be to try to work on side projects as much as possible, because classes will only teach you programming fundamentals in C++. You’ll have to learn other languages on your own, and it would be impossible to get a job without any other knowledge.

They do have lineups but they aren’t nearly as bad as pike or sig pi. Kap sig and Phi Delt are new and to my knowledge neither of them haze very hard. The 2 top frats are pike and sig pi, and sig chi has a good rep but their parties suck and they don’t have good houses. Nice guys, but I can’t really take them seriously they are more like a social  group/mixture of a business frat and a real frat. Also they get a lot of shit because everyone thinks they are gay because of the way they treat each other is kinda fake ngl.",1

SCU is a very expensive school which means that it attracts wealthy students whose backgrounds make it possible for them to attain high-paying jobs. *Those wealthy students were already going to be relatively successful no matter the school they chose.* So, by concentrating at SCU, it inflates the salary statistics after graduation. 

My personal recommendation would be to go to the cheaper school.",1

3. For SCU as a whole, on-campus food was a bit expensive. For the CS/Math department? Maybe I wish that upper divs were offered more frequently? Some of the upper-div classes were only offered every other year, so you have to plan around that. If you study abroad (for example), it might prevent you from taking an upper div you're interested in.

If you’re looking for your college experience to include week-night parties, late night drinking with the guys and all that jazz, then yeah you’re going to want to look at a fraternity. *not to mention a good friend group. 
I was apart of one, likely the furthest from what you’re looking for in a frat. I’d ask you to at least keep an open mind and head out to rush week during winter quarter. 

We’re a small school. Like 5-6 frats where only 2 have more than 100 members. And they vary big time in just overall identity. Keep in mind this is SCU - not a Georgia, LSU, or USC.

My point being... Keep an open mind. Your vision of what a Greek life looks like is likely much more aggressive than what scu really is. At the end of the day, if you choose not to join a fraternity you will still have a great social life at Santa Clara.

I really enjoyed getting into the UI/UX side of it, since I was originally straight COEN. That being said I get like I missed out on something fundamental in programming. Idk. I ended up becoming a UI/UX designer for 2 years then went to Hack Reactor to sharpen my JS skills and then went on for 3 years of dev work (bringing us to today).

If you want to go this route, don’t let your programming just sit in class work. Build some shit and deploy it to Heroku or AWS.",7
3813,me6qy8,gsednsj,,"As one myself (sorry my flair isn’t updated to reflect that), it’s around 14 units less than CSE majors (175 compared to 189), you only need one natural science (chemistry or physics), but you would practically have the same same calculus courses (1 to 4) and similar core requirements.

I guess you should do Web Design if you’re not really into low level assembly code which is heavily stressed in CSE curriculum. Web Design is for UI/UX development, graphic design , and technical knowledge that essentially could lead to a career in front -back-fullstack development and /or product design I’m guessing.

Keep in mind that major title doesn’t matter in the long run, it primarily comes down to experience and personal knowledge you aspire to gain from outside of classes to drive yourself in your desired career path.

In addition, if you choose to do Web Design, you could potentially pick up a CSE minor (which is what I’m highly considering ) which basically has two normal CSE classes - COEN 21 logic design and COEN 20 intro to embedded system and your other web programming classes as part of that minor requirement so it’s actually quite convenient and in line with your visions.

I am not sure if do any Verilog in his class, if you take the ELEN version you will be writing some Verilog.

I personally prefer Jim.

The ELEN version you will go over more digital logic than the COEN version.

If you want to take the 'easier' class, COEN version is probably easier.

But computer architecture is a very important class imo, I'm about to finish my master's here. The material comes up a lot. I recommend the advanced courses after if you can take them, if not, you still learn the most important stuff in the first one.

Only downside I guess for the ELEN verison is you go over MIPS which is a dead architecture, COEN version you will either go over ARM or RISC V. It doesn't really make any difference though.",1

Besides from the occasional frat boy and outliers, everyone is pretty smart and being surrounded by people of such fortitude can only make you a better performer in the classroom.

3863,m8i6px,grkbdg6,Futureproducer99,"There’s not much to do in the direct area around SCU, but there’s lots to do within a short drive. Beyond the San Jose area, there’s really nice beaches like Santa Cruz and Half Moon bay, and you can also take the Caltrain (right by campus) to go to SF or other parts of the west bay like Palo Alto. It’s a little limiting freshman year when the school doesn’t let you have a car on campus, but if you can get one/make friends with someone with one after that it’s absolutely huge. I personally enjoyed the area significantly more once I got a car.

As for the size, it definitely has its pros and cons. Personally, I think SCU’s size is perfect; small enough to have a tight sense of overall community but big enough that, even as a senior, I am still meeting new people and making new friends.",5
3864,m8i6px,grojo66,SCUSKU,"Congrats on the scholarship! That in and of itself is a big accomplishment, and personally I would consider that enough to make the decision. That being said, from the friends I've had in the Civil Engineering program, they all love it because it is a very small and tightly knit group of passionate students. I think you'll find plenty of support, success, and energy from your peers and professors within the Civil Engineering program. Additionally, you can make tons of friends via the dorm you choose to live in (the more social the better, i.e. Swig, Dunne), the clubs/sororities/fraternities you join, and also meeting people through classes. SCU is also a few hours to a bunch of outdoorsy places like Tahoe (skiing), Santa Cruz (surfing), and hiking spots all around in the surrounding hills. Not to mention SF, Carmel, Berkely, etc.

I would say the only downside SCU has compared to a large sized school is smaller facilities and a lack of major sporting events. That said, a new engineering building is currently under construction that is frankly massive, so that problem will go away within a year or so. We would love to welcome you to the Bronco family and I sincerely hope you choose SCU! Congrats!",3

3868,m6ose1,gr76asl,5torm,Depends on if you’re looking for a place to yourself or with roommates. The difference between the two could be nearly double if you’re  only interested in a place to yourself.

3889,m1qyex,grol0wv,SCUSKU,"Hey warrior\_poets. SCU has a few niche clubs that offer tremendous real world, hands-on experience, but you sort of have to seek it out and be willing to make a large commitment. For example, a couple years ago SCU students participated in building the Solar Decathalon house, which was quite literally building a house from scratch. Another was the Tiny House project. Engineers Without Borders also offers lots of real world experience, where you can actually deliver your product to people in developing countries. That said, this isn't robotics-y.

I would say your best bet would be twofold. First, check out the Robotics Systems Lab. It's sort of a hidden gem of SCU that I found by coincidence. It is on the 3rd level of Guadalupe Hall on the north eastern most side of the building. There isn't exactly a pipeline into it, you basically have to either know someone and work on their project, or just keep showing up and see if there's anything you can get involved with. It's tricky, and was uncomfortable in my experience, but well worth it. 

The other would be mostly self study, and learning from peers by doing in the Maker Lab, which is also on the third floor of Guadalupe Hall. Personally, I learned a lot by picking up the Arduino Starter Kit and working through that my freshman year, which led to me having better understanding of how hardware and software interface, and how to wire circuits and such.   


SCU also does offer robotics classes (MECH 337, 338) as graduate classes, which you can take your junior/senior year.

That said, SCU probably doesn't have a particularly well defined robotics curriculum for undergrads, but college really is what you make of it.  I actually work at a startup that came out of the SCU Robotics Lab and know a lot of mechatronics engineers from the RSL who are exceptionally talented. If you are serious about robotics I would say the only way to get serious about it at SCU is going to be through the RSL, and most likely with a graduate (i.e. Master's) degree. I hope this sheds some more light on your question and would be happy to follow up.",4
3890,m1qyex,gqj15pa,MeEngineerMuchGood,You could just get involved with the robotics lab. It might as well be a student club if it's at all like it was when I was in school a few years ago.,2
3891,m1qyex,gqgcgxx,warrior_poets,"Thanks. I assume that is related to the SIOTLAB? How do the labs work generally? Are they open to any student, those in specific classes or those doing research or......?",1
3892,m1qyex,grprgqp,warrior_poets,Thanks very much.,1
3893,m1qyex,gqj1hsy,warrior_poets,Yeah that would be cool.,1
3894,m1qyex,gql7z7c,hor1z0n_,Yeah it’s related to that! I don’t know much but check out https://www.scu.edu/engineering/academic-programs/department-of-computer-engineering/research/scu-internet-of-things-research-lab/,2
3895,lx1pa1,gpn68h4,kickbuttowski_89,"Great university/course for job prospects. SCU’s and SJSU’s CS programs are feeders to the Silicon Valley job market.. I won’t say you’ll learn a lot but the high percentage of international students in the MS program who are hustling to land the best internship/job will keep you on your toes and motivate you to do better.. if a high paying job out of university is your aim, this is a great school.",2
3896,lx1pa1,grolx8l,SCUSKU,"Hey XolotiCat, I am SCU MS class of 2020, so a recent grad. I tacked on another year onto my undergrad to complete the MS. I would say the MS program is ok, but really not particularly exceptional. MS in CS is going to be substantially stronger a top schools like MIT,  Stanford, CMU, as well as ""second tier"" schools like University of Washington, etc. 

I certainly would not attend SCU CS MS without a strong idea of what you want to get out of it. You can pretty easily get away with ""BSing"" your way through the MS taking easy classes. I know of plenty of people who did this and I certainly question whether it was worth their time and money. I would check to see if SCU offers classes in a specific domain of CS that you're interested in and evaluate the program from there. 

In my case, I was interested in computer vision. SCU happens to offer a decent amount of classes in the field and I also took the path of writing a master's thesis. Although it wasn't groundbreaking by any means (basically just reinvented the wheel), it added a lot of value to my education. Anyways, my 2 cents.",2

3900,lx1pa1,gpoyg4b,AlterBlitz,"Rankings are mostly based on research and SCU isn't really known for its research. USNews ranked it at #53 which I believe is decent for a small university.

In any case you should try and find clubs and orgs that interest you and show up and meet people. Also don’t worry if you don’t find your group immediately, I didn’t find my group until my 2nd year and I know people who didn’t have a solid friend group until even later in some cases.

3960,lonaag,gobii0b,noel_deltoro,"Hi! SCU is a great place to be because of it's smaller student body! There are only about 5,500 students at SCU compared to Purdue and UIUC with I believe to be \~40,000 students! Smaller student body means you are going to have much smaller class sizes with a greater opportunity of forming mentorships and connections with your professors. Also, you can't beat being in the Silicon Valley for Computer Science!

3962,lod7do,go7lkp2,superman65456,"C++ for sure. If you plan on doing data science and such, Python for sure. And last but not least, although not emphasized a lot, LaTeX (which is a *markup* language, but has some programming elements) as a personal recommendation. The profs in the Math/CS dept use LaTeX a lot, but don’t expect students to use them. However, even though that LaTeX is primarily used in academia, it is a very powerful tool in technical documentation in general. Given that the classes are online (for now), why not give it a try? Diagrams (e.g. UML diagrams and automata, which something you will learn later on in automata theory) and plots in LaTeX are of very high quality.",1

3965,lod7do,go7m7wa,superman65456,"Oh, like software engineering? Hmmmmmmm this is a hard question for me to answer, because it depends on where you want to go. Some of the languages are Java, C++, HTML, and some areas are mobile app dev, full stack, etc. I’m not a CS major (I kind of wish I had been on the mathier side), but from what I heard, UML diagrams are essential to software engineering (you can confirm this with COEN or CS majors). One thing that I must stress is LaTeX, as technical communication is necessary in software engineering reports. LaTeX is an underrated tool; many people say that it’s not useful for industry, but in reality, it depends on the job.",2

3974,lbkt8p,gly44xb,BookishChica,"I attended IU (many years ago) but also have 2 teens now who plan to apply to IU and SCU, only one is interested in business tho. One wants to experience college life in Cali and the other is mostly looking at northeast schools but has identified a few Bay Area schools he likes. We visited those schools right before covid and SCU was one of them. My boys are used to spending time at IU sporting events and tailgates, etc. so a couple of their initial observations had to do with the social aspect of SCU. My older son didn’t know if he could attend a school without a football program. I know, it seems immature. But they’ve been used to going to big 10 games all their lives. They also wondered about the size of the campus and surrounding area. It seemed to be nestled in a residential neighborhood and not a college town, again, unlike the big 10 schools they’re used to. Since you mentioned wanting to have fun and a chill vibe, I wanted to comment on that. IU definitely has that. The business school may be highly ranked but the atmosphere is laid back and fun in so many ways. It is a quintessential college experience. I’m encouraging my kids to go west and east simply bc we’ve had so much of IU, Purdue, and even Notre Dame. It’s time for something different for them. You can’t go wrong with either business school. (Personally I know many successful graduates from Kelley.)",2
